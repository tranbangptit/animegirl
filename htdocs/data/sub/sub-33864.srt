1
00:00:03,679 --> 00:00:07,379
I felt like I had a lot of time.

2
00:00:07,380 --> 00:00:09,744
I know.

3
00:00:09,745 --> 00:00:13,711
It's good. I'm good.

4
00:00:13,712 --> 00:00:17,345
Yeah. We're, um... we're
just getting off the freeway.

5
00:00:17,346 --> 00:00:18,945
Yeah?

6
00:00:18,946 --> 00:00:21,412
Did, Hugh pick you up
at the office, or...

7
00:00:21,413 --> 00:00:24,012
Yeah, he was coming in from Oakland.

8
00:00:24,013 --> 00:00:27,544
He was late, of course.
Then I took him...

9
00:00:27,545 --> 00:00:31,944
And then, he took me
to some lawyer bar.

10
00:00:31,945 --> 00:00:33,810
A lawyer bar?

11
00:00:33,811 --> 00:00:36,577
Yeah. A lawyer bar, kind of.

12
00:00:36,578 --> 00:00:40,078
Yeah. I don't know. Everybody
there seemed like a lawyer.

13
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:42,211
I felt like I was the only
person without a tie.

14
00:00:42,212 --> 00:00:45,811
Well, maybe we should get
you a tie for emergencies.

15
00:00:45,812 --> 00:00:47,345
Yeah, wardrobe emergencies.

16
00:00:47,346 --> 00:00:48,978
Yeah.

17
00:00:48,979 --> 00:00:53,678
Anyhow, we tried to take
the freeway and...

18
00:00:53,679 --> 00:00:56,444
Ke... Kevin?

19
00:00:56,445 --> 00:00:58,877
I can barely hear you.

20
00:00:58,878 --> 00:01:01,379
Is that better?

21
00:01:01,380 --> 00:01:03,444
Not much.

22
00:01:03,445 --> 00:01:06,311
Where are you?
Are you there yet?

23
00:01:06,312 --> 00:01:11,576
Yeah, I... I'm just
pulling up right now.

24
00:01:11,577 --> 00:01:15,181
I just got here.
Um...

25
00:01:15,979 --> 00:01:18,345
Yeah. I'm right here.

26
00:01:18,346 --> 00:01:22,544
I... You know what? I need to parallel
park and I'm not on my earpiece.

27
00:01:22,545 --> 00:01:24,411
Okay.

28
00:01:24,412 --> 00:01:26,578
Are you good?

29
00:01:26,579 --> 00:01:28,277
Yeah.

30
00:01:28,278 --> 00:01:30,378
You know, we should
talk about, you know...

31
00:01:30,379 --> 00:01:32,312
Maybe we can talk about, you know,

32
00:01:32,313 --> 00:01:35,178
that little problem before
we get into the party.

33
00:01:35,179 --> 00:01:37,178
Okay.

34
00:01:37,179 --> 00:01:41,478
Is it something we should
talk about now, or...

35
00:01:41,479 --> 00:01:43,410
Hello?

36
00:01:43,411 --> 00:01:45,345
Kevin?

37
00:01:45,346 --> 00:01:47,444
I lost you.

38
00:01:47,445 --> 00:01:49,112
Oh.

39
00:01:49,113 --> 00:01:51,678
Baby?

40
00:01:54,979 --> 00:01:58,646
You gotta be kidding me.

41
00:01:59,110 --> 00:02:01,844
I think olive oil would be good.
A little more maybe?

42
00:02:01,845 --> 00:02:03,312
- A drizzle.
- A little more.

43
00:02:03,313 --> 00:02:06,311
- Is this turning you on?
- That is hot.

44
00:02:06,312 --> 00:02:08,376
See how you're slipping?
This is...

45
00:02:08,377 --> 00:02:10,978
- It's... It's the bread, babe.
- It's the two of you with the knives that...

46
00:02:10,979 --> 00:02:13,011
I have not had carbs for a week.

47
00:02:13,012 --> 00:02:14,810
I've been on this...
this "cleanse."

48
00:02:14,811 --> 00:02:16,944
How long have you
been cleansing for?

49
00:02:16,945 --> 00:02:18,945
About 21 days.

50
00:02:18,946 --> 00:02:21,511
I had my juice and my
smoothie earlier today...

51
00:02:21,512 --> 00:02:23,943
and I do feel very, you know...

52
00:02:23,944 --> 00:02:26,844
- Cleansed? Open?
- A little faint maybe?

53
00:02:26,845 --> 00:02:28,409
But I'm gonna eat,

54
00:02:28,410 --> 00:02:30,145
I'm gonna drink and
have a good time.

55
00:02:30,146 --> 00:02:32,111
Hi.

56
00:02:32,112 --> 00:02:33,744
- Hey.
- How are you guys?

57
00:02:33,745 --> 00:02:36,010
Nice to see you.

58
00:02:36,011 --> 00:02:38,310
- Bend down to my level, please.
- I know.

59
00:02:38,311 --> 00:02:41,343
So, I just had Kevin on the
phone and this happened.

60
00:02:41,344 --> 00:02:42,943
It cracked.

61
00:02:42,944 --> 00:02:44,511
As I was talking to him.

62
00:02:44,512 --> 00:02:46,411
- You dropped it.
- Our connection... No, I didn't drop it.

63
00:02:46,412 --> 00:02:48,443
It just cracked as I was holding it.

64
00:02:48,444 --> 00:02:50,212
Do you have insurance?

65
00:02:50,213 --> 00:02:52,045
I... I actually don't know if I do.

66
00:02:52,046 --> 00:02:54,344
Do you have the Skype
app I showed you?

67
00:02:54,345 --> 00:02:57,244
No, I think it's fine. He just said
he wanted to talk about something,

68
00:02:57,245 --> 00:02:59,776
But on the news, you know,
they're talking about the comet.

69
00:02:59,777 --> 00:03:01,311
- Yeah.
- The Miller's Comet.

70
00:03:01,312 --> 00:03:04,211
And they keep telling people
that this can happen.

71
00:03:04,212 --> 00:03:05,877
Yeah. I don't think it's the comet.

72
00:03:05,878 --> 00:03:07,945
If you have Skype, it
uses the home Wi-Fi.

73
00:03:07,946 --> 00:03:10,978
No. The interference.
They're saying things break.

74
00:03:10,979 --> 00:03:14,680
Hey, do you want some wine?

75
00:03:17,178 --> 00:03:20,544
Did Amir mention to you that...

76
00:03:20,545 --> 00:03:23,278
he's bringing Laurie...

77
00:03:23,279 --> 00:03:25,678
to dinner?

78
00:03:25,679 --> 00:03:27,143
He's bringing Laurie?

79
00:03:27,144 --> 00:03:29,509
Yeah. The Laurie.

80
00:03:29,510 --> 00:03:33,510
Um, no, I didn't know that.
I didn't know that.

81
00:03:33,511 --> 00:03:34,978
- Who's Laurie?
- Well, he is.

82
00:03:34,979 --> 00:03:38,777
- You know Laurie.
- Oh, Mike.

83
00:03:38,778 --> 00:03:43,711
Long black hair.
Kind of vixeny.

84
00:03:43,712 --> 00:03:45,977
Wild and sexy.

85
00:03:45,978 --> 00:03:48,477
- Oh.
- Kinda strange, very mysterious.

86
00:03:48,478 --> 00:03:51,011
- Very tight, tight, tight dresses.
- Listen.

87
00:03:51,012 --> 00:03:53,710
It's totally fine.
It's such an Amir thing to do.

88
00:03:53,711 --> 00:03:55,310
I was going to keep this...

89
00:03:55,311 --> 00:03:57,343
This, my friends.

90
00:03:57,344 --> 00:04:01,245
It's my own little rescue
remedy concoction.

91
00:04:01,246 --> 00:04:03,810
- Right.
- It's our own mix.

92
00:04:03,811 --> 00:04:06,510
- It's pretty s... It's very safe, I think.
- Do you want a needle for that?

93
00:04:06,511 --> 00:04:09,011
- Is it clean?
- You can drop it into some water.

94
00:04:09,012 --> 00:04:11,011
Just take the edge off,
in case you're worried.

95
00:04:11,012 --> 00:04:13,045
I don't know.
I'm just... I'm offering.

96
00:04:13,046 --> 00:04:15,576
It's echinacea, passion
flower, a little valerian...

97
00:04:15,577 --> 00:04:17,044
and ketamine.

98
00:04:17,045 --> 00:04:19,411
- So it's all natural.
- Ketamine?

99
00:04:19,412 --> 00:04:21,844
That doesn't sound natural at all.
That's a horse tranquilizer.

100
00:04:21,845 --> 00:04:24,377
- Yeah, but it's just a whisper of ketamine.
- I did that once.

101
00:04:24,378 --> 00:04:26,377
I just thought maybe
a celebration...

102
00:04:26,378 --> 00:04:28,676
Are you offering this to me,
because Laurie's coming here?

103
00:04:28,677 --> 00:04:30,211
Well, I'm just saying...

104
00:04:30,212 --> 00:04:33,344
- Now it's a party.
- Ketamine or cheese?

105
00:04:33,345 --> 00:04:36,145
It's right here if you change
your mind. Oh, this is nice.

106
00:04:36,146 --> 00:04:37,812
Where'd you get this?

107
00:04:37,813 --> 00:04:39,244
Galaxy, that thrift store.

108
00:04:39,245 --> 00:04:41,577
- Oh, I love that place.
- Me too. I know.

109
00:04:41,578 --> 00:04:43,078
Oh. Hi.

110
00:04:43,079 --> 00:04:44,778
- Hi, baby.
- What?

111
00:04:44,779 --> 00:04:47,744
- Come on. Come here.
- All right.

112
00:04:47,745 --> 00:04:49,410
My wife.

113
00:04:49,411 --> 00:04:51,846
- Hi.
- Hey.

114
00:04:52,644 --> 00:04:54,477
- How are you?
- Hi. I'm good.

115
00:04:54,478 --> 00:04:56,145
- Hi.
- Hi.

116
00:04:56,146 --> 00:04:58,744
- Do you guys want wine?
- I do.

117
00:04:58,745 --> 00:05:00,947
Cheese? Ketamine?

118
00:05:01,745 --> 00:05:03,444
You look so good in leather.

119
00:05:03,445 --> 00:05:06,210
Jesus Christ.

120
00:05:06,211 --> 00:05:09,252
- Um...
- I want water or something.

121
00:05:11,946 --> 00:05:13,643
Did you know that, um,

122
00:05:13,644 --> 00:05:16,177
- Laurie is coming?
- There you go.

123
00:05:16,178 --> 00:05:18,677
No.

124
00:05:18,678 --> 00:05:20,309
- Laurie's coming?
- Yeah.

125
00:05:20,310 --> 00:05:22,177
Look at the smile on your face.

126
00:05:22,178 --> 00:05:24,978
- It's not a smile. It's not that smile.
- Oh, my God.

127
00:05:24,979 --> 00:05:27,276
- Why is she coming tonight?
- Amir's bringing her.

128
00:05:27,277 --> 00:05:30,077
Beats me, because
Amir's a total jackass.

129
00:05:30,078 --> 00:05:31,277
Oh.

130
00:05:31,278 --> 00:05:33,911
You know what? Put a quarter
into the swear jar.

131
00:05:33,912 --> 00:05:35,811
So, who did he tell?

132
00:05:35,812 --> 00:05:37,877
Well, we got the...
Yeah.

133
00:05:37,878 --> 00:05:40,011
We got an e-mail about it.
Just his plus one.

134
00:05:40,012 --> 00:05:44,149
Plus one and then I
was, like, plus what?

135
00:05:47,944 --> 00:05:50,243
I need to know tonight?

136
00:05:50,244 --> 00:05:53,810
My editor needs to know how
to book hotels and flights.

137
00:05:53,811 --> 00:05:57,547
I gotta do it.
Let them know.

138
00:05:58,345 --> 00:06:01,348
Gotta know tonight.

139
00:06:03,145 --> 00:06:05,112
You know I-I...
I can't...

140
00:06:05,113 --> 00:06:06,778
I-I just need to think about it...

141
00:06:06,779 --> 00:06:08,610
a little bit longer because...

142
00:06:08,611 --> 00:06:10,310
I just don't want to
make the wrong choice.

143
00:06:10,311 --> 00:06:11,878
What if you came for a shorter time?

144
00:06:11,879 --> 00:06:15,667
Like a month, not the full 4 months.
Just come for a month.

145
00:06:15,668 --> 00:06:17,444
It's still a very long time...

146
00:06:17,445 --> 00:06:19,011
and I'm not saying no.

147
00:06:19,012 --> 00:06:24,579
Babe, if you don't say
yes, it becomes a no.

148
00:06:26,077 --> 00:06:28,344
We're cold and hungry.

149
00:06:28,345 --> 00:06:30,309
Hello?

150
00:06:30,310 --> 00:06:32,110
- Hello.
- Hi.

151
00:06:32,111 --> 00:06:34,844
- Amir, you look great.
- Thank you.

152
00:06:34,845 --> 00:06:36,544
- Hi.
- You remember Laurie?

153
00:06:36,545 --> 00:06:38,269
Amir told me I wouldn't be...

154
00:06:38,270 --> 00:06:40,677
- Overdressed, now I'm feeling...
- No. No, no.

155
00:06:40,678 --> 00:06:43,978
We're underdressed.

156
00:06:43,979 --> 00:06:45,777
- Hi.
- Hi.

157
00:06:45,778 --> 00:06:47,309
- How are you?
- I'm good.

158
00:06:47,310 --> 00:06:49,144
- Beth, do you remember Laurie?
- Yes.

159
00:06:49,145 --> 00:06:51,810
- Nice to see you.
- You guys already said hello and...

160
00:06:51,811 --> 00:06:53,476
How are you?
Good to see you.

161
00:06:53,477 --> 00:06:55,777
You guys want red wine?

162
00:06:55,778 --> 00:06:58,344
Yes. I would love red wine.

163
00:06:58,345 --> 00:07:00,810
- Lee?
- I've been cooking. I've been cooking.

164
00:07:00,811 --> 00:07:03,511
- How have you been?
- I've been good. I've been really good.

165
00:07:03,512 --> 00:07:05,577
- You?
- I've been great.

166
00:07:05,578 --> 00:07:09,143
Yeah. Life is looking very different
from how it was a while back.

167
00:07:09,144 --> 00:07:11,845
- In a good way, so...
- Well, cool. That's good to hear.

168
00:07:11,846 --> 00:07:15,913
- I would hope so. There you go.
- Thank you.

169
00:07:16,711 --> 00:07:18,477
Not A, C, E.

170
00:07:18,478 --> 00:07:20,110
"Horace, listen.

171
00:07:20,111 --> 00:07:22,810
I'll be down at the pyramid.
Come on down and join.

172
00:07:22,811 --> 00:07:24,878
We gotta talk about
some deity stuff."

173
00:07:24,879 --> 00:07:26,977
Does everyone else
still not have service?

174
00:07:26,978 --> 00:07:29,644
My phone is completely broken.

175
00:07:29,645 --> 00:07:32,911
I'm living in the moment, but...

176
00:07:32,912 --> 00:07:35,177
- Nothing.
- I got zero.

177
00:07:35,178 --> 00:07:37,910
That's weird.
Maybe the tower's down.

178
00:07:37,911 --> 00:07:39,944
The tower's down?

179
00:07:39,945 --> 00:07:42,044
I'm telling you guys...

180
00:07:42,045 --> 00:07:44,010
- It's not down.
- That would be a big news story.

181
00:07:44,011 --> 00:07:47,076
Comet. Comet.

182
00:07:47,077 --> 00:07:50,077
- Miller's Comet.
- Yes. Thank you.

183
00:07:50,078 --> 00:07:54,677
I read something this morning
about a comet in the 1930s.

184
00:07:54,678 --> 00:07:56,211
It was in Finland.

185
00:07:56,212 --> 00:07:58,043
- Knocked out all of the...
- I actually...

186
00:07:58,044 --> 00:08:00,510
the cell towers?

187
00:08:00,511 --> 00:08:03,877
Actually, it was in 1923.

188
00:08:03,878 --> 00:08:05,543
And, yes, it was in Finland.

189
00:08:05,544 --> 00:08:09,143
- Um...
- Thank you, Wikipedia.

190
00:08:09,144 --> 00:08:11,910
It was actually crazy,
because it affected the people.

191
00:08:11,911 --> 00:08:14,911
After it passed,
they would get lost.

192
00:08:14,912 --> 00:08:17,510
They would end up in the wrong home.
They would forget things.

193
00:08:17,511 --> 00:08:19,578
They wouldn't really
know where they were.

194
00:08:19,579 --> 00:08:22,209
And I remember reading
about this one woman...

195
00:08:22,210 --> 00:08:24,811
who called the police and said,

196
00:08:24,812 --> 00:08:27,670
"The man in my house
is not my husband."

197
00:08:27,671 --> 00:08:29,342
And then police came over...

198
00:08:29,343 --> 00:08:31,944
and they said,
"This is your husband,"

199
00:08:31,945 --> 00:08:33,544
And she said, "No. This
is not my husband.

200
00:08:33,545 --> 00:08:35,844
- I killed my husband yesterday.
- Awesome.

201
00:08:35,845 --> 00:08:37,544
That's how I know it's not him."

202
00:08:37,545 --> 00:08:40,177
But they couldn't arrest her,
because he was standing...

203
00:08:40,178 --> 00:08:41,911
right there in front in them.

204
00:08:41,912 --> 00:08:43,976
Do they have any theories of why?

205
00:08:43,977 --> 00:08:47,209
Think how lucky she is.
She gets to kill him again.

206
00:08:47,210 --> 00:08:48,843
Clearly she wants to kill this man.

207
00:08:48,844 --> 00:08:50,444
- It's just the Finnish.
- The Finns.

208
00:08:50,445 --> 00:08:52,376
The Finns or Finnish?

209
00:08:52,377 --> 00:08:54,911
- You guys remember Halley's Comet?
- Yes.

210
00:08:54,912 --> 00:08:56,578
I mean, it was such a big deal.

211
00:08:56,579 --> 00:09:00,243
I remember at my school, we all had
to, like, reenact Halley's Comet.

212
00:09:00,244 --> 00:09:04,143
So, they assigned each of us
something celestial to do.

213
00:09:04,144 --> 00:09:06,611
My sister got to be Halley's Comet.
I was very jealous.

214
00:09:06,612 --> 00:09:09,344
I've never met your sister.
Have you guys met her sister?

215
00:09:09,345 --> 00:09:11,678
There's a picture of her right
over there on the mantel, but...

216
00:09:11,679 --> 00:09:14,143
- She's only a fleeting comet.
- she looks a little ridiculous.

217
00:09:14,144 --> 00:09:15,943
- That's your sister?
- But why did you put it...

218
00:09:15,944 --> 00:09:17,644
It's the door to nowhere.

219
00:09:17,645 --> 00:09:19,478
In feng shui, a useless door,

220
00:09:19,479 --> 00:09:21,276
which this is obviously
a useless door,

221
00:09:21,277 --> 00:09:23,110
you put a picture of someone...

222
00:09:23,111 --> 00:09:24,977
you have unresolved issues with...

223
00:09:24,978 --> 00:09:27,277
and it causes all of
this weird energy flow.

224
00:09:27,278 --> 00:09:29,209
I don't even like being over here.

225
00:09:29,210 --> 00:09:31,976
- It's freaky.
- You shouldn't be over there then.

226
00:09:31,977 --> 00:09:33,543
- Every time you're...
- I'm sort of an empath.

227
00:09:33,544 --> 00:09:37,176
- Sort of an empath.
- And I can feel it. It's like a vortex.

228
00:09:37,177 --> 00:09:39,911
When was the last time we
were all together like this?

229
00:09:39,912 --> 00:09:42,043
I was thinking, right
before Thanksgiving,

230
00:09:42,044 --> 00:09:45,144
most of us were there, but
not everybody could be.

231
00:09:45,145 --> 00:09:46,777
I don't think Laurie...
Laura?

232
00:09:46,778 --> 00:09:48,311
- Laurie.
- Laurie.

233
00:09:48,312 --> 00:09:50,309
Sorry. We're gonna tell
all these stories.

234
00:09:50,310 --> 00:09:52,110
We do that when we get together.

235
00:09:52,111 --> 00:09:54,276
So Laurie, what are
you doing these days?

236
00:09:54,277 --> 00:09:56,443
- Well, I'm...
- Keeping yourself busy?

237
00:09:56,444 --> 00:09:57,943
I'm keeping busy.

238
00:09:57,944 --> 00:10:00,110
I'm actually working with some
outreach programs in Silicon Valley.

239
00:10:00,111 --> 00:10:02,210
We work with at-risk youth.

240
00:10:02,211 --> 00:10:04,909
Oh, wow. Didn't you...
No, no, no.

241
00:10:04,910 --> 00:10:06,911
Are you still teaching the yoga?

242
00:10:06,912 --> 00:10:09,077
The Spanish Yoga?
The Spoga?

243
00:10:09,078 --> 00:10:11,677
- No. Not me.
- Are you sure that...

244
00:10:11,678 --> 00:10:13,343
Oh, that must've
been another girl...

245
00:10:13,344 --> 00:10:16,644
that Kevin dated that
Amir is hooking up with.

246
00:10:16,645 --> 00:10:19,044
Wow. Let's give him a shovel.

247
00:10:19,045 --> 00:10:21,143
What are you doing?
What do you do for a living?

248
00:10:21,144 --> 00:10:24,077
I act. Shut up, guys.

249
00:10:24,078 --> 00:10:25,975
I didn't remember you were an actor.

250
00:10:25,976 --> 00:10:28,875
- So, you do mainly theater?
- Well, I did.

251
00:10:28,876 --> 00:10:33,511
Since I moved down here to support
my wife and her Skyping career.

252
00:10:33,512 --> 00:10:37,977
Um, but, no, I was in a TV
show for about 4 years.

253
00:10:37,978 --> 00:10:39,843
- Yeah? What was that?
- It was called Roswell.

254
00:10:39,844 --> 00:10:41,710
Oh, my God.
I love Roswell.

255
00:10:41,711 --> 00:10:44,778
When were you on Roswell?
What episodes were you on?

256
00:10:44,779 --> 00:10:47,511
I was on all shows.
Produced.

257
00:10:47,512 --> 00:10:49,976
- What do you mean?
- I was a series regular on that show.

258
00:10:49,977 --> 00:10:51,611
Yeah, he was, like, the main guy.

259
00:10:51,612 --> 00:10:53,111
What character did you play?

260
00:10:53,112 --> 00:10:56,710
- Joe.
- Did you have different hair, or something?

261
00:10:56,711 --> 00:10:58,276
I had the same exact hair.

262
00:10:58,277 --> 00:11:01,209
I'm sorry. Maybe it's one of
those things where you know...

263
00:11:01,210 --> 00:11:04,310
the character for so long, then you see
someone in person. It just doesn't compute.

264
00:11:04,311 --> 00:11:05,677
I don't know.

265
00:11:05,678 --> 00:11:11,377
- He's sort of grown into his face.
- You really have.

266
00:11:11,378 --> 00:11:12,942
Check it out again.

267
00:11:12,943 --> 00:11:16,043
I'm sure, you know, like the downward
dog probably gets to your head.

268
00:11:16,044 --> 00:11:18,311
- I didn't do yoga. That wasn't...
- Well, hey, listen.

269
00:11:18,312 --> 00:11:20,710
Thanks for enjoying the show.

270
00:11:20,711 --> 00:11:23,211
I think you are a
really good actor...

271
00:11:23,212 --> 00:11:24,843
and I think you should
continue doing it.

272
00:11:24,844 --> 00:11:28,043
- Thank you very much.
- I think it would be well worth your time.

273
00:11:28,044 --> 00:11:29,810
What are you up to these days?

274
00:11:29,811 --> 00:11:31,711
Last I remember, you were, like,

275
00:11:31,712 --> 00:11:34,042
taking the dance world by storm.

276
00:11:34,043 --> 00:11:36,077
Um, I guess the last
time I saw you...

277
00:11:36,078 --> 00:11:39,910
must've been when I was
creating the dance show.

278
00:11:39,945 --> 00:11:43,176
It was going really,
really well for a while,

279
00:11:43,177 --> 00:11:46,744
but then, right before
the, um... the premiere,

280
00:11:46,745 --> 00:11:49,310
they brought in Svetlana Aserrano...

281
00:11:49,311 --> 00:11:53,344
who is the best dancer
in the world really,

282
00:11:53,345 --> 00:11:55,410
and they just offered
me the understudy.

283
00:11:55,411 --> 00:11:57,210
She should've been the whole thing.

284
00:11:57,211 --> 00:11:58,943
She created it.
She should be...

285
00:11:58,944 --> 00:12:01,634
- the prima ballerina of the San Francisco Ballet.
- That's terrible.

286
00:12:01,635 --> 00:12:03,578
You know, you hear these
stories sometimes...

287
00:12:03,579 --> 00:12:06,810
about people being shut out
of things they created...

288
00:12:06,811 --> 00:12:09,410
and I think it's horrible.
I'm sorry.

289
00:12:09,411 --> 00:12:13,578
But I mean it's a good lesson
that I had to learn, because...

290
00:12:13,579 --> 00:12:16,010
You know, because of my
pride, I didn't want...

291
00:12:16,011 --> 00:12:18,143
to take the understudy
and I took too long...

292
00:12:18,144 --> 00:12:22,143
to think about it and then
I lost the understudy job.

293
00:12:22,144 --> 00:12:25,674
And they gave that to
Katherine Meriss and...

294
00:12:25,675 --> 00:12:26,810
And she sucks.

295
00:12:26,811 --> 00:12:28,477
- She sucks.
- No, she's good, guys.

296
00:12:28,478 --> 00:12:30,344
Anyways, the reason that
she's really big now...

297
00:12:30,345 --> 00:12:32,243
is because she ended up going up.

298
00:12:32,244 --> 00:12:33,909
Svetlana pulled out last minute...

299
00:12:33,910 --> 00:12:38,578
and Katherine ended
up doing the show.

300
00:12:38,579 --> 00:12:40,677
- Katherine Meriss?
- Exactly.

301
00:12:40,678 --> 00:12:42,676
As soon as you said that,
I thought, "Katherine Meriss...

302
00:12:42,677 --> 00:12:45,409
that's pretty much the only
person in dance I'd know."

303
00:12:45,410 --> 00:12:47,343
Right. Well...

304
00:12:47,344 --> 00:12:51,243
So, she basically stole
your... your whole thing?

305
00:12:51,244 --> 00:12:54,909
Katherine Meriss has
your life, basically.

306
00:12:54,910 --> 00:12:57,678
- Career.
- You have your life.

307
00:12:57,679 --> 00:13:00,411
It's a shame that it happened.
She doesn't hold a candle to you.

308
00:13:00,412 --> 00:13:03,743
Then, here's to the
life that we do lead.

309
00:13:03,744 --> 00:13:05,310
- Yeah.
- Well said.

310
00:13:05,311 --> 00:13:08,010
- Here's to the comet.
- The comet. And the comet.

311
00:13:08,011 --> 00:13:10,176
Anybody have a happier story?

312
00:13:10,177 --> 00:13:12,343
Kevin, tell a crazy story, first
one that comes in your head.

313
00:13:12,344 --> 00:13:14,843
No. All right.

314
00:13:14,844 --> 00:13:17,777
Um...
Sorry.

315
00:13:17,778 --> 00:13:19,310
I was going out with Laurie.

316
00:13:19,311 --> 00:13:21,976
We were drinking way
too much at a bar.

317
00:13:21,977 --> 00:13:24,478
I passed out and I
started dreaming...

318
00:13:24,479 --> 00:13:27,178
this big black bear...

319
00:13:27,179 --> 00:13:30,577
was up on its hind legs
sort of mauling me.

320
00:13:30,578 --> 00:13:33,311
Slowly. Tenderly.

321
00:13:33,312 --> 00:13:35,044
Anyhow, we go to some party...

322
00:13:35,045 --> 00:13:36,976
in Santa Cruz and as we walked in,

323
00:13:36,977 --> 00:13:39,344
this huge dog comes
running straight at me.

324
00:13:39,345 --> 00:13:41,876
Jumps up on its hind legs
and starts pawing me,

325
00:13:41,877 --> 00:13:45,276
exactly like the dream,
and this guy yells,

326
00:13:45,277 --> 00:13:49,809
- "Bear, get down, Bear."
- What?

327
00:13:49,810 --> 00:13:52,376
Wow.
You have a gift.

328
00:13:52,377 --> 00:13:54,511
The way you told that
story, I thought...

329
00:13:54,512 --> 00:13:56,510
somebody was going to die.

330
00:13:56,511 --> 00:13:59,510
You know Bear is the
most common dog name.

331
00:13:59,511 --> 00:14:03,444
Oh, that makes it a much
less interesting story.

332
00:14:03,445 --> 00:14:05,077
Thanks for that, Lee.

333
00:14:05,078 --> 00:14:08,613
Most common bear name? Henry.

334
00:14:09,411 --> 00:14:12,244
- Look.
- Oh, my God.

335
00:14:12,245 --> 00:14:14,377
- What?
- This is like your phone.

336
00:14:14,378 --> 00:14:16,476
Oh, my God. That happened
to my phone tonight.

337
00:14:16,477 --> 00:14:19,044
And I was just holding
mine in my hand.

338
00:14:19,045 --> 00:14:21,443
- Exact same thing.
- Shattered?

339
00:14:21,444 --> 00:14:23,776
Yeah. This is what they were
talking about on the news.

340
00:14:23,777 --> 00:14:25,577
Yeah. Yeah.
It must be the comet.

341
00:14:25,578 --> 00:14:27,977
- The chicken tastes like tuna.
- All right.

342
00:14:27,978 --> 00:14:30,710
It must be Miller's Comet.

343
00:14:30,711 --> 00:14:32,477
So, nobody's phone works?

344
00:14:32,478 --> 00:14:34,409
I haven't checked mine,
but I assume it doesn't.

345
00:14:34,410 --> 00:14:36,310
Everyone else's is
in the other room.

346
00:14:36,311 --> 00:14:40,844
- Do you guys have a landline?
- No. We're wireless, baby.

347
00:14:40,845 --> 00:14:45,211
All right. I need to get
ahold of my brother.

348
00:14:45,212 --> 00:14:47,809
- What about, um, your deal...
- The computer.

349
00:14:47,810 --> 00:14:49,309
- Good idea.
- It's in the office.

350
00:14:49,310 --> 00:14:51,042
- Could I?
- Yeah, yeah. Thanks.

351
00:14:51,043 --> 00:14:53,343
- What's wrong with your brother?
- Nothing. He's fine.

352
00:14:53,344 --> 00:14:56,709
He just, um...
You know Brian.

353
00:14:56,710 --> 00:14:59,409
He hangs out with all those, you
know, theoretical physicists.

354
00:14:59,410 --> 00:15:01,843
- No Internet.
- No?

355
00:15:01,844 --> 00:15:03,942
- On the computer.
- How is there no Internet?

356
00:15:03,943 --> 00:15:06,809
- You run Skype. You tell us.
- I know.

357
00:15:06,810 --> 00:15:09,476
What are they saying
about the comet?

358
00:15:09,477 --> 00:15:12,842
Nothing... Nothing
to get upset about.

359
00:15:12,843 --> 00:15:15,277
He just said to give him a call,

360
00:15:15,278 --> 00:15:17,278
you know, if there was
anything weird going on.

361
00:15:17,279 --> 00:15:19,110
Like, why? What did
he think it could do?

362
00:15:19,111 --> 00:15:20,743
Why didn't you tell me this?

363
00:15:20,744 --> 00:15:22,310
Because of your feng shui...

364
00:15:22,311 --> 00:15:24,776
- and granola candles, and I didn't want to...
- Stop making fun of me.

365
00:15:24,777 --> 00:15:26,276
I'm not making fun of you.

366
00:15:26,277 --> 00:15:27,909
There's a massive celestial object,

367
00:15:27,910 --> 00:15:29,410
and I didn't want to freak you out.

368
00:15:29,411 --> 00:15:31,010
- Now you're freaking me out.
- You guys realize...

369
00:15:31,011 --> 00:15:32,477
I was on a show called Roswell...

370
00:15:32,478 --> 00:15:35,044
and we tackled these
issues every week.

371
00:15:35,045 --> 00:15:37,609
That's true.

372
00:15:37,610 --> 00:15:39,477
- Oh, shit.
- Oh, my God.

373
00:15:39,478 --> 00:15:41,443
- Honey.
- Um, I'm on it.

374
00:15:41,444 --> 00:15:43,042
Do we have candles?

375
00:15:43,043 --> 00:15:44,545
I'm so glad I'm not high.

376
00:15:44,546 --> 00:15:48,109
I don't want to sit by
the door to nowhere.

377
00:15:48,110 --> 00:15:51,710
Mike, check the breakers.

378
00:15:51,711 --> 00:15:54,143
I'm going to turn the lighter
on then come to you.

379
00:15:54,144 --> 00:15:57,009
- You guys need help?
- No. I have matches.

380
00:15:57,010 --> 00:15:59,677
- Candle power?
- I've got some over here.

381
00:15:59,678 --> 00:16:03,176
I got blue glowsticks, red
glowsticks and green glowsticks.

382
00:16:03,177 --> 00:16:05,942
Guys, let's just
light candles and...

383
00:16:05,943 --> 00:16:07,910
Oh.

384
00:16:07,911 --> 00:16:10,010
- Hey.
- Everybody rave.

385
00:16:10,011 --> 00:16:11,944
- Are you going outside?
- Yeah.

386
00:16:11,945 --> 00:16:13,444
What do you mean,
you're going outside?

387
00:16:13,445 --> 00:16:17,694
I'm gonna see if the power's
off in the whole neighborhood.

388
00:16:22,044 --> 00:16:24,842
I decided this is where mine goes.

389
00:16:24,843 --> 00:16:26,710
Well, this is a little strange,

390
00:16:26,711 --> 00:16:28,576
but the whole neighborhood is out...

391
00:16:28,577 --> 00:16:31,575
of power, except for a
house about 2 blocks up,

392
00:16:31,576 --> 00:16:33,077
which is completely lit up.

393
00:16:33,078 --> 00:16:34,809
It's kind of beautiful, actually.

394
00:16:34,810 --> 00:16:37,543
- The house?
- I want to go see.

395
00:16:37,544 --> 00:16:41,277
- Let's go check it out.
- I've never seen it so dark outside before.

396
00:16:41,278 --> 00:16:43,543
- You can't leave me. I'm gonna go.
- Come on then.

397
00:16:43,544 --> 00:16:45,009
Don't leave me by myself.

398
00:16:45,010 --> 00:16:48,110
- Where?
- You don't see it?

399
00:16:48,111 --> 00:16:50,710
- It's right there.
- Why are you so far ahead of everyone?

400
00:16:50,711 --> 00:16:52,744
Amir, dude, I can't see you.

401
00:16:52,745 --> 00:16:54,776
- Let Laurie go first.
- Thanks a lot.

402
00:16:54,777 --> 00:16:57,777
- That's sweet.
- Baby. Don't go.

403
00:16:57,778 --> 00:16:59,742
- Come here.
- See? Look.

404
00:16:59,743 --> 00:17:03,014
- Everything done.
- Come here.

405
00:17:04,811 --> 00:17:07,309
See that?

406
00:17:07,310 --> 00:17:09,677
- Two blocks down.
- Oh, they have light.

407
00:17:09,678 --> 00:17:12,476
- That one house has light.
- They must have a...

408
00:17:12,477 --> 00:17:14,110
- A generator, or something?
- Yeah, yeah.

409
00:17:14,111 --> 00:17:15,742
What is that, two blocks away?

410
00:17:15,743 --> 00:17:17,243
Could solar power do that?

411
00:17:17,244 --> 00:17:19,642
But would their landline be working?

412
00:17:19,643 --> 00:17:21,110
Oh, wow.
Look at that.

413
00:17:21,111 --> 00:17:24,510
- Oh, wow.
- It's magnificent.

414
00:17:24,511 --> 00:17:27,147
Holy moly.

415
00:17:29,943 --> 00:17:31,476
Well, I'm freezing.

416
00:17:31,477 --> 00:17:33,177
Should we head over
there, or should we...

417
00:17:33,178 --> 00:17:36,481
- No.
- Maybe we should head back inside.

418
00:17:38,978 --> 00:17:41,677
That was awesome, right?

419
00:17:42,371 --> 00:17:44,842
- I didn't even see this get knocked over.
- No.

420
00:17:44,843 --> 00:17:46,644
I didn't even know that
glass was out here.

421
00:17:46,645 --> 00:17:48,210
I never go down into the basement.

422
00:17:48,211 --> 00:17:51,177
Guys, listen. Seriously,
what's up with that house?

423
00:17:51,178 --> 00:17:52,909
- Why are they...?
- What?

424
00:17:52,910 --> 00:17:54,475
It could be a generator.

425
00:17:54,476 --> 00:17:55,378
Really?

426
00:17:55,379 --> 00:17:57,976
I don't know. Maybe they're
just off-the-grid bastard...

427
00:17:57,977 --> 00:17:59,509
Well, apparently,
we have a generator.

428
00:17:59,510 --> 00:18:01,443
That would make sense if
they were off the grid.

429
00:18:01,444 --> 00:18:05,542
I'm actually thinking of...
of going over there.

430
00:18:05,543 --> 00:18:07,176
What?

431
00:18:07,177 --> 00:18:09,810
- No, you're not going over there.
- Honey, it's okay.

432
00:18:09,811 --> 00:18:12,276
- It's o...
- It's ridiculous.

433
00:18:12,277 --> 00:18:14,809
It's not that far.
Look, look, look, look.

434
00:18:14,810 --> 00:18:17,242
My brother, he says...

435
00:18:17,243 --> 00:18:20,943
he said that if... if anything
strange were to happen...

436
00:18:20,944 --> 00:18:23,310
while the comet was passing over...

437
00:18:23,311 --> 00:18:26,643
- that we should stay inside.
- What?

438
00:18:26,644 --> 00:18:28,344
Just hold on, Amir.

439
00:18:28,345 --> 00:18:31,976
That we should stay inside and that
I should do my best to contact him.

440
00:18:31,977 --> 00:18:33,475
And so that's all that I'm doing.

441
00:18:33,476 --> 00:18:37,643
He said if anything strange
should happen? I mean...

442
00:18:37,644 --> 00:18:40,443
I'm not the only one who
thinks this is strange.

443
00:18:40,444 --> 00:18:42,376
- What is weird?
- Didn't he say to stay inside though?

444
00:18:42,377 --> 00:18:44,442
What's more important
than the other?

445
00:18:44,443 --> 00:18:47,344
Yes, but this overrides that,
and it's only two blocks away.

446
00:18:47,345 --> 00:18:49,543
I'll be back in, like, 5 minutes.

447
00:18:49,544 --> 00:18:52,310
- Well, then you can't go by yourself.
- I'm going with him.

448
00:18:52,311 --> 00:18:54,977
There you go.
I'll take Amir.

449
00:18:54,978 --> 00:18:57,343
- I'm the least important person here.
- This is true.

450
00:18:57,344 --> 00:18:59,076
It's about time you
started realizing that.

451
00:18:59,077 --> 00:19:01,810
- Just stay here.
- Why are you going now?

452
00:19:01,811 --> 00:19:04,310
Well, bring your glowsticks so
we can identify your bodies.

453
00:19:04,311 --> 00:19:06,744
- Good idea.
- Thanks. That helps a lot.

454
00:19:06,745 --> 00:19:08,743
- Don't listen to them.
- That's great.

455
00:19:08,744 --> 00:19:10,244
5 minutes, all right?

456
00:19:10,245 --> 00:19:11,976
- Okay. 5 minutes.
- All right. Okay.

457
00:19:11,977 --> 00:19:13,777
Beth, I-I couldn't find my shoes.

458
00:19:13,778 --> 00:19:15,244
I'm borrowing yours.
I'm sorry.

459
00:19:15,245 --> 00:19:18,080
That's so Amir.

460
00:19:18,878 --> 00:19:22,011
- 10 minutes we give them.
- They will be fine.

461
00:19:22,012 --> 00:19:25,177
We're just rattled because we're
addicted to cell phones and Internet.

462
00:19:25,178 --> 00:19:27,409
We are. What did we do
before cell phones?

463
00:19:27,410 --> 00:19:30,877
Em, you seem to be the
comet expert here tonight.

464
00:19:30,878 --> 00:19:32,442
What happened the last time?

465
00:19:32,443 --> 00:19:35,409
This one passed over a hundred
years ago, but much farther.

466
00:19:35,410 --> 00:19:37,810
But do we know that
anything happened?

467
00:19:37,811 --> 00:19:40,210
Nothing happened then.
It was too far away.

468
00:19:40,211 --> 00:19:41,910
So, is there any reason...

469
00:19:41,911 --> 00:19:43,410
we should be freaked out right now?

470
00:19:43,411 --> 00:19:46,876
Well, I mean, it is a
lot closer this time.

471
00:19:46,877 --> 00:19:48,776
What does that mean?

472
00:19:48,777 --> 00:19:50,609
Okay. I read one more thing.

473
00:19:50,610 --> 00:19:53,376
- Oh, another story.
- Just one more.

474
00:19:53,377 --> 00:19:55,142
It's called the Tunguska Event...

475
00:19:55,143 --> 00:19:58,177
and, um, it was a comet...

476
00:19:58,178 --> 00:20:00,077
or a meteor or
something like that...

477
00:20:00,078 --> 00:20:02,742
that entered the
atmosphere over Siberia...

478
00:20:02,743 --> 00:20:05,576
and exploded over Earth.

479
00:20:05,577 --> 00:20:08,077
So, it didn't actually
have physical impact.

480
00:20:08,078 --> 00:20:10,010
It didn't touch Earth.

481
00:20:10,011 --> 00:20:11,643
It didn't leave a
crater or anything,

482
00:20:11,644 --> 00:20:14,076
but the force of that explosion...

483
00:20:14,077 --> 00:20:17,877
flattened trees for
hundreds of miles.

484
00:20:17,878 --> 00:20:21,143
But it only killed about
one to two people.

485
00:20:21,144 --> 00:20:24,076
It's Siberia. There were
probably only two people there.

486
00:20:24,077 --> 00:20:25,676
Yeah, but they don't necessarily...

487
00:20:25,677 --> 00:20:28,143
- It wiped out the population of Siberia.
- Basically. Yeah.

488
00:20:28,144 --> 00:20:29,876
- Right.
- Well, that doesn't make me feel better.

489
00:20:29,877 --> 00:20:31,710
And when was this?

490
00:20:31,711 --> 00:20:35,044
It was, like, in 1908, 1903...

491
00:20:35,311 --> 00:20:38,276
Oh, my God, oh, my God,
oh, my God. What is...

492
00:20:38,277 --> 00:20:41,777
- What the fuck was that?
- I don't know.

493
00:20:41,778 --> 00:20:43,811
- Lock that front door.
- Don't open the door.

494
00:20:43,812 --> 00:20:45,909
- I'm gonna get the bat.
- Yeah. Give me the bat.

495
00:20:45,910 --> 00:20:47,542
Mike, is that door locked?

496
00:20:47,543 --> 00:20:49,643
- I'll check it.
- Babe, stay away from the door.

497
00:20:49,644 --> 00:20:51,276
- You need the stick?
- Thank you.

498
00:20:51,277 --> 00:20:53,976
No, no, no.

499
00:20:54,343 --> 00:20:58,042
- I just want to see what the hell is out there.
- Oh, my God.

500
00:20:58,043 --> 00:21:00,543
- Don't open it.
- Oh, God.

501
00:21:00,544 --> 00:21:03,545
Please, don't open that.

502
00:21:04,059 --> 00:21:07,109
- Is anybody there?
- Front door's locked. There's nothing.

503
00:21:07,110 --> 00:21:08,844
There's nothing out there.

504
00:21:08,845 --> 00:21:10,642
Thought I was going to
have a heart attack.

505
00:21:10,643 --> 00:21:12,476
Everybody all right?

506
00:21:12,477 --> 00:21:15,443
Check the generator, please.
Please try the generator.

507
00:21:15,444 --> 00:21:17,277
- I'll check the generator.
- Would the guys do that?

508
00:21:17,278 --> 00:21:19,276
No. The guys would not
do anything like that.

509
00:21:19,277 --> 00:21:20,977
They're not stupid.
They wouldn't do that.

510
00:21:20,978 --> 00:21:22,642
- How long have they been gone?
- Like 10 minutes.

511
00:21:22,643 --> 00:21:25,342
5 minutes out, 5 minutes back.
They should be back by now.

512
00:21:25,343 --> 00:21:27,077
So, they should be back by now.

513
00:21:27,078 --> 00:21:29,576
- Okay. I think we should go get them.
- No, no, no.

514
00:21:29,577 --> 00:21:31,076
I want to go get my husband.

515
00:21:31,077 --> 00:21:32,976
We need to do it together
this time, guys.

516
00:21:32,977 --> 00:21:34,710
That's fine with me.
I just want to go.

517
00:21:34,711 --> 00:21:37,977
- Don't go outside.
- I'm not going anywhere. I'm just...

518
00:21:37,978 --> 00:21:42,776
We should go get them.
We can all go together.

519
00:21:42,777 --> 00:21:45,844
Okay, all right.
This is good.

520
00:21:45,845 --> 00:21:48,276
Is that the grid or the generator?

521
00:21:48,277 --> 00:21:50,209
No, it's just us.
He must have gotten it going.

522
00:21:50,210 --> 00:21:51,744
There's no other lights on?
It's just us?

523
00:21:51,745 --> 00:21:55,976
- It's pitch black out there. At least it's on.
- So it must be...

524
00:21:55,977 --> 00:21:57,675
- Well done.
- Thank you.

525
00:21:57,676 --> 00:22:00,143
- You did it.
- Let there be light.

526
00:22:00,144 --> 00:22:03,408
Okay. Well, I think
that we should...

527
00:22:03,409 --> 00:22:06,309
As a group, we should
go find those guys.

528
00:22:06,310 --> 00:22:09,442
- I agree.
- Let's do it as a group this time.

529
00:22:09,443 --> 00:22:11,176
No. That's ridiculous.

530
00:22:11,177 --> 00:22:13,208
If you get lost in the
woods, you're supposed...

531
00:22:13,209 --> 00:22:15,175
to stay where you are until
someone can find you.

532
00:22:15,176 --> 00:22:17,576
Fine. That's great. Let's
just sit down and breathe.

533
00:22:17,577 --> 00:22:21,011
For once, I actually agree
with what you're saying.

534
00:22:21,012 --> 00:22:23,275
You know what? You've been
giving me shit all night.

535
00:22:23,276 --> 00:22:27,278
- I am agreeing with you.
- Guys, guys, guys.

536
00:22:28,077 --> 00:22:29,877
I don't like any of this.

537
00:22:29,878 --> 00:22:33,643
Jesus!

538
00:22:33,644 --> 00:22:35,309
Stay.

539
00:22:35,310 --> 00:22:37,712
Oh, my God.

540
00:22:38,510 --> 00:22:41,080
Oh man, it's them.

541
00:22:41,740 --> 00:22:43,844
- What the hell happened?
- Are you okay?

542
00:22:43,845 --> 00:22:47,442
- I'm fine, I'm fine.
- Are you okay?

543
00:22:47,443 --> 00:22:50,110
What is this?

544
00:22:50,643 --> 00:22:53,675
- What's the box?
- That was at the other house.

545
00:22:53,676 --> 00:22:55,210
I thought I saw Hugh put it down.

546
00:22:55,211 --> 00:22:57,043
Then he was running
around the corner and...

547
00:22:57,044 --> 00:22:59,176
- You just took it?
- I just followed him.

548
00:22:59,177 --> 00:23:01,342
- I didn't... I had it in my hand.
- Why was he running?

549
00:23:01,343 --> 00:23:03,876
- Hugh, what happened?
- I'm fine, I'm fine.

550
00:23:03,877 --> 00:23:07,409
- Did you put this down?
- Amir, why the fuck did you take that?

551
00:23:07,410 --> 00:23:10,208
- I thought I saw you put it down.
- I did not touch that thing.

552
00:23:10,209 --> 00:23:12,643
I don't know what that is
or why you grabbed it.

553
00:23:12,644 --> 00:23:16,009
- Guys, what happened?
- Okay. We were at the other house.

554
00:23:16,010 --> 00:23:18,610
Hugh went around the side.
I thought I heard a noise.

555
00:23:18,611 --> 00:23:21,209
You made some kind of sound, and
then you saw what? Something.

556
00:23:21,210 --> 00:23:22,743
You won't tell me what you saw.

557
00:23:22,744 --> 00:23:25,876
I don't understand what's going on.
What did you see?

558
00:23:25,877 --> 00:23:27,376
- I don't...
- What did you see?

559
00:23:27,377 --> 00:23:29,043
That has nothing to
do with anything...

560
00:23:29,044 --> 00:23:30,643
that we should be
fucking concerned with.

561
00:23:30,644 --> 00:23:32,442
What did you see?

562
00:23:32,443 --> 00:23:35,676
- It's not a big deal. I'll walk it back.
- Okay, fine.

563
00:23:35,677 --> 00:23:37,310
Wait. Let me open it first.

564
00:23:37,311 --> 00:23:39,210
No, Mike.
What are you doing?

565
00:23:39,211 --> 00:23:42,175
- What is it?
- I don't know. I don't know.

566
00:23:42,176 --> 00:23:44,709
You don't want to talk about it
and you don't want to open...

567
00:23:44,710 --> 00:23:47,842
Fine! Open the fucking box!
Open the box. What do I care?

568
00:23:47,843 --> 00:23:49,710
What is wrong?
Calm down.

569
00:23:49,711 --> 00:23:52,543
What happened?

570
00:23:52,544 --> 00:23:55,209
Holy shit, it worked.

571
00:23:55,210 --> 00:23:56,744
I got it.

572
00:23:56,745 --> 00:23:58,275
Open it away from your face.

573
00:23:58,276 --> 00:24:00,777
- It's not a bomb.
- How do you know what the heck it is?

574
00:24:00,778 --> 00:24:04,647
- Don't freak out.
- Be careful.

575
00:24:06,444 --> 00:24:09,809
Oh, my God, It's a ping-pong paddle.
It's a ping-pong paddle.

576
00:24:09,810 --> 00:24:14,015
- Well, what's that?
- What is going on?

577
00:24:16,811 --> 00:24:19,675
- Oh, my God.
- What is it?

578
00:24:19,676 --> 00:24:23,746
These are pictures of all of us.

579
00:24:24,544 --> 00:24:27,810
These are...

580
00:24:27,811 --> 00:24:30,308
- Somebody's marked us.
- I want to try to figure this out.

581
00:24:30,309 --> 00:24:32,241
- This is insane.
- And there are numbers on the back.

582
00:24:32,242 --> 00:24:34,142
- Hugh.
- Baby, what did you see?

583
00:24:34,143 --> 00:24:35,976
- Hugh what did you see?
- What did you see?

584
00:24:35,977 --> 00:24:37,609
Jesus Christ, man.

585
00:24:37,610 --> 00:24:42,379
You can't stand there and not
say anything! What did you see?

586
00:24:43,177 --> 00:24:45,877
Hugh!

587
00:24:45,878 --> 00:24:48,410
There are pictures
of us in this box!

588
00:24:48,411 --> 00:24:51,452
Hugh!

589
00:24:59,243 --> 00:25:02,476
I went to the window,
and I looked in the window.

590
00:25:02,477 --> 00:25:04,909
And I saw a table...

591
00:25:04,910 --> 00:25:08,809
with wine glasses and candles...

592
00:25:08,810 --> 00:25:13,842
and dinner set for eight people.

593
00:25:13,843 --> 00:25:17,479
I saw...

594
00:25:18,277 --> 00:25:19,809
Oh, my God.

595
00:25:19,810 --> 00:25:21,910
Right.
Okay, fuck you, Hugh.

596
00:25:21,911 --> 00:25:23,577
- I saw...
- Bullshit.

597
00:25:23,578 --> 00:25:26,709
- Did you guys come and fuck with this door?
- Fuck you, Kevin.

598
00:25:26,710 --> 00:25:28,123
Did you come to the side door?

599
00:25:28,124 --> 00:25:30,109
No. You went to the side
door at the other house.

600
00:25:30,110 --> 00:25:31,877
They wouldn't answer
the door, so I went...

601
00:25:31,878 --> 00:25:33,476
Bullshit.

602
00:25:33,477 --> 00:25:36,677
You dipshits walked in a circle
and knocked on this door.

603
00:25:36,678 --> 00:25:39,276
I did not walk in a fucking circle!
I went two blocks.

604
00:25:39,277 --> 00:25:41,410
We went up to that house.
I knocked at the door.

605
00:25:41,411 --> 00:25:44,143
Nobody answered, so I went
and banged on the side door.

606
00:25:44,144 --> 00:25:46,643
- Did you see yourself, Hugh?
- No, I did not see myself.

607
00:25:46,644 --> 00:25:50,609
- No, because you weren't there.
- I did not go in a circle!

608
00:25:50,610 --> 00:25:52,944
Fuck.
Just calm down.

609
00:25:52,945 --> 00:25:54,476
I don't believe this.

610
00:25:54,477 --> 00:25:56,076
This still doesn't
explain the pictures.

611
00:25:56,077 --> 00:25:57,742
What's on the back of them?

612
00:25:57,743 --> 00:25:59,743
Numbers.

613
00:25:59,744 --> 00:26:05,210
They're all...
We've got two, one, one.

614
00:26:05,211 --> 00:26:07,710
That's five.

615
00:26:07,711 --> 00:26:10,743
- Whoa, whoa, whoa. Where are you going?
- I'm gonna go back over there.

616
00:26:10,744 --> 00:26:13,710
- Whoa.
- No, no, no. Think about it.

617
00:26:13,711 --> 00:26:16,108
I'm gonna go back over there. I'm
gonna ask to use their phone...

618
00:26:16,109 --> 00:26:17,876
and, hopefully, I can get
in touch with my brother.

619
00:26:17,877 --> 00:26:19,763
And if they're not there,
I'll just leave a note. Right?

620
00:26:19,764 --> 00:26:20,743
No.

621
00:26:20,744 --> 00:26:22,243
No, no, no. That makes sense. Right?

622
00:26:22,244 --> 00:26:24,710
- You should not go back.
- It's fine. It'll be fine.

623
00:26:24,711 --> 00:26:27,779
It'll be fucking fine.

624
00:26:29,576 --> 00:26:32,347
What's a note going to do?

625
00:26:35,143 --> 00:26:39,743
If these people have pictures
of us, they might be crazy.

626
00:26:39,744 --> 00:26:41,141
Shit! There's someone out there.

627
00:26:41,142 --> 00:26:42,777
There's someone out there.

628
00:26:42,778 --> 00:26:45,276
- What?
- Oh, my God.

629
00:26:45,277 --> 00:26:47,075
Oh, there's a big guy at the door.

630
00:26:47,076 --> 00:26:49,110
- Oh, my God.
- At the door?

631
00:26:49,111 --> 00:26:50,709
What should we do?

632
00:26:50,710 --> 00:26:52,310
He's walking away. He's walking away.
Please, please.

633
00:26:52,311 --> 00:26:55,352
Baby, please be careful.
Oh, my God.

634
00:27:00,444 --> 00:27:01,943
- Baby.
- Careful.

635
00:27:01,944 --> 00:27:05,116
- Shit.
- What?

636
00:27:10,909 --> 00:27:14,511
What is it, babe?

637
00:27:15,309 --> 00:27:19,743
"Hey, there. Don't mean
to freak you guys out,

638
00:27:19,744 --> 00:27:24,343
but we just wanted to borrow
your phone for five minutes tops.

639
00:27:24,344 --> 00:27:27,120
Thanks."

640
00:27:34,911 --> 00:27:36,743
Two kinds.

641
00:27:36,744 --> 00:27:39,877
Regular Band-Aid or cloth?

642
00:27:40,676 --> 00:27:42,942
Whatever.

643
00:27:42,943 --> 00:27:46,743
Cloth. Okay. Here we go.

644
00:27:46,744 --> 00:27:49,443
Sorry, sorry, sorry.

645
00:27:49,444 --> 00:27:54,777
These are ones. This is a two.
We are four, five, six.

646
00:27:54,778 --> 00:27:56,810
Do you have any red markers?

647
00:27:56,811 --> 00:28:01,410
Okay. Why are these three ones?

648
00:28:01,411 --> 00:28:04,276
- This is a six. Five.
- Hugh and Lee.

649
00:28:04,277 --> 00:28:06,476
Two.

650
00:28:07,210 --> 00:28:09,010
Four.

651
00:28:09,011 --> 00:28:10,942
And that's the same picture.

652
00:28:10,943 --> 00:28:14,778
Oh, my God.

653
00:28:15,576 --> 00:28:18,281
Somebody cut that in half.

654
00:28:21,077 --> 00:28:23,109
Where are these from?

655
00:28:23,110 --> 00:28:26,008
Could this be like numerology?

656
00:28:26,009 --> 00:28:28,710
Like if you add up
all the numbers...

657
00:28:28,711 --> 00:28:30,410
in your name and the birthday...

658
00:28:30,411 --> 00:28:32,543
Like life path numbers
or something like that?

659
00:28:32,544 --> 00:28:35,075
If that's the case, then they're just
crazy and it doesn't matter anyway.

660
00:28:35,076 --> 00:28:37,242
So, what do all the
ones have in common?

661
00:28:37,243 --> 00:28:40,175
Um, we have Lee...
Date of birth?

662
00:28:40,176 --> 00:28:42,142
- Oldest to youngest?
- There's no three?

663
00:28:42,143 --> 00:28:44,409
- There's no three.
- There's no three.

664
00:28:44,410 --> 00:28:48,309
Is there someone... Is there
someone that would want to be...

665
00:28:48,310 --> 00:28:49,875
doing this to us?

666
00:28:49,876 --> 00:28:53,176
Is there someone that is
on someone's bad side?

667
00:28:53,177 --> 00:28:56,109
What?
This was taken tonight.

668
00:28:56,110 --> 00:28:59,175
What? How do you know that?

669
00:28:59,176 --> 00:29:04,278
I bought this sweater today,
so that's from tonight.

670
00:29:05,076 --> 00:29:08,310
Has anyone taken a
picture of you tonight?

671
00:29:08,311 --> 00:29:11,176
Someone took a picture of you
when you were looking at the box.

672
00:29:11,177 --> 00:29:12,976
You were looking into the lens.

673
00:29:12,977 --> 00:29:15,376
But then it was already in the box.

674
00:29:15,377 --> 00:29:18,542
What is that?

675
00:29:18,543 --> 00:29:20,075
I can't tell what that is.

676
00:29:20,076 --> 00:29:22,176
There's dots on the wall
and there's a lampshade.

677
00:29:22,177 --> 00:29:24,042
None of the others are
from tonight. Right?

678
00:29:24,043 --> 00:29:26,876
No. This our picture.
This is from last fall.

679
00:29:26,877 --> 00:29:29,442
- This picture of Amir was taken over here.
- How do you know that?

680
00:29:29,443 --> 00:29:31,676
- He's standing in front of this drum.
- Guys, hang on.

681
00:29:31,677 --> 00:29:33,075
I can't figure out what this is.

682
00:29:33,076 --> 00:29:34,842
It's taken from the door?

683
00:29:34,843 --> 00:29:36,242
So, from behind the curtain?

684
00:29:36,243 --> 00:29:37,776
It's taken from over there.

685
00:29:37,777 --> 00:29:40,442
Wait. When someone knocked
on the door, were you there?

686
00:29:40,443 --> 00:29:42,208
You were gone.

687
00:29:42,209 --> 00:29:45,611
But you're looking
right at the camera.

688
00:29:46,409 --> 00:29:50,276
So, it would be from
that door, then. Right?

689
00:29:50,277 --> 00:29:52,043
You don't remember... I mean,

690
00:29:52,044 --> 00:29:54,842
this is you, man. This is you.

691
00:29:54,843 --> 00:29:58,442
Guys, this isn't going
to solve anything.

692
00:29:58,443 --> 00:29:59,976
What're you doing?

693
00:29:59,977 --> 00:30:02,575
I need a drink.
I need something.

694
00:30:02,576 --> 00:30:04,443
The... The pictures?

695
00:30:04,444 --> 00:30:07,584
All right. Me too.

696
00:30:13,377 --> 00:30:16,309
It looks like my handwriting, babe.

697
00:30:16,310 --> 00:30:19,514
Look at this.

698
00:30:22,709 --> 00:30:24,741
It looks like I wrote this.

699
00:30:24,742 --> 00:30:26,741
Okay, relax.

700
00:30:26,742 --> 00:30:29,675
You're starting to freak me out.

701
00:30:29,676 --> 00:30:33,114
That's your handwriting.

702
00:30:35,910 --> 00:30:38,480
What is going on?

703
00:30:41,276 --> 00:30:44,651
I feel like I'm losing my mind.

704
00:30:50,370 --> 00:30:52,841
I can't stop thinking about
the fact that you...

705
00:30:52,842 --> 00:30:58,909
brought up a story you
shared with Laurie.

706
00:30:58,910 --> 00:31:02,009
Of all the stories
that you could've...

707
00:31:02,010 --> 00:31:04,142
All the experiences
that we've shared,

708
00:31:04,143 --> 00:31:05,875
you brought up a story about her?

709
00:31:05,876 --> 00:31:08,176
- I am so sorry.
- In front of everyone.

710
00:31:08,177 --> 00:31:11,009
It's a crazy story. We don't
have stories like that.

711
00:31:11,010 --> 00:31:12,942
Oh, they're not crazy
enough for you.

712
00:31:12,943 --> 00:31:15,410
Baby, it's a good thing.
Oh, God.

713
00:31:15,411 --> 00:31:17,509
I don't need crazy stories
like that anymore.

714
00:31:17,510 --> 00:31:21,277
All right. Hey, um, fuck this.
Let's just... Let's go.

715
00:31:21,278 --> 00:31:23,076
I'm gonna go over there
and, theoretically,

716
00:31:23,077 --> 00:31:25,508
let's go see if our
theoretical selves are there.

717
00:31:25,509 --> 00:31:27,142
No, no, no.
I'm going.

718
00:31:27,143 --> 00:31:30,542
I'm in. There's some weird
stuff happening here.

719
00:31:30,543 --> 00:31:32,108
I think we should...

720
00:31:32,109 --> 00:31:33,576
- I think we should evaluate...
- Please, can we...

721
00:31:33,577 --> 00:31:35,543
- I just evaluated and I'm going.
- Can we stay here?

722
00:31:35,544 --> 00:31:38,075
- If there's another me, I want to see me.
- No. No way.

723
00:31:38,076 --> 00:31:39,809
- No, no.
- Let's go.

724
00:31:39,810 --> 00:31:41,309
- Look.
- I'm over this.

725
00:31:41,310 --> 00:31:43,143
I'm getting sick of
talking about it.

726
00:31:43,144 --> 00:31:44,642
I'm getting sick of
writing about it.

727
00:31:44,643 --> 00:31:47,342
- The same fucking paper, the pictures...
- Wait.

728
00:31:47,343 --> 00:31:49,377
There's nobody trying to hurt us.

729
00:31:49,378 --> 00:31:51,509
We go find out what
the hell is going on.

730
00:31:51,510 --> 00:31:54,442
What about you? You were
the one who wanted to go.

731
00:31:54,443 --> 00:31:57,309
That's when I thought
they might have a phone.

732
00:31:57,310 --> 00:32:01,542
Four glowsticks. Can we
please keep two guys here?

733
00:32:01,543 --> 00:32:03,942
- Two guys staying here? Please?
- I'm staying, I'm staying.

734
00:32:03,943 --> 00:32:06,310
Are you going?
Amir, please.

735
00:32:06,311 --> 00:32:08,042
Let's go.

736
00:32:08,043 --> 00:32:09,675
So, what? We're splitting up again?

737
00:32:09,676 --> 00:32:11,242
No. We're not splitting up.

738
00:32:11,243 --> 00:32:14,008
We're just gonna go in two
different groups. Oh. Okay.

739
00:32:14,009 --> 00:32:15,909
Sticks, sticks, sticks.

740
00:32:15,910 --> 00:32:17,609
Do we need a towel on it?

741
00:32:17,610 --> 00:32:19,841
I'm coming.
Wait.

742
00:32:19,842 --> 00:32:22,041
Chill for a second.
I'm coming.

743
00:32:22,042 --> 00:32:23,909
- Why?
- Because I want to go.

744
00:32:23,910 --> 00:32:26,447
I'm going with Kevin.

745
00:32:29,243 --> 00:32:31,976
- Give us 20 minutes.
- All right.

746
00:32:31,977 --> 00:32:34,476
- And then what?
- Are we taking the bat?

747
00:32:34,477 --> 00:32:37,109
No. We'll be fine. You will be fine.
It's gonna be all right.

748
00:32:37,110 --> 00:32:40,086
We'll find out what's going on.

749
00:32:47,877 --> 00:32:52,229
No cars. No people.
There's nothing.

750
00:33:11,009 --> 00:33:13,208
Guys, look.

751
00:33:13,843 --> 00:33:17,210
That's my house.

752
00:33:17,211 --> 00:33:21,679
Mike.
This is my house.

753
00:33:23,477 --> 00:33:25,276
Mike, this isn't right.

754
00:33:25,277 --> 00:33:27,741
Mike, this is not your house.

755
00:33:27,742 --> 00:33:30,746
Mike.

756
00:33:31,544 --> 00:33:33,775
- My house.
- This is not your house, Mike.

757
00:33:33,776 --> 00:33:36,975
Mike.
This is not your house.

758
00:33:36,976 --> 00:33:40,978
What is he doing?
Kevin.

759
00:33:41,776 --> 00:33:46,475
I see... I see Lee.
Guys.

760
00:33:46,476 --> 00:33:49,909
We have to go. Let's
get out of here now.

761
00:33:49,910 --> 00:33:51,874
Mike, we need to get
the hell out of here.

762
00:33:51,875 --> 00:33:53,775
Someone's coming.

763
00:33:53,776 --> 00:33:57,295
Someone's coming.
Go. Just go.

764
00:34:40,843 --> 00:34:43,245
That's just nuts.

765
00:34:45,042 --> 00:34:47,841
So, you saw four
figures, same as you?

766
00:34:47,842 --> 00:34:50,941
Except they had red glowsticks.

767
00:34:50,942 --> 00:34:52,876
Who had red glowsticks?

768
00:34:52,877 --> 00:34:54,674
They had the red glowsticks.

769
00:34:54,675 --> 00:34:57,474
We had the blue glowsticks.
That was the only difference.

770
00:34:57,475 --> 00:35:00,043
So, they must've opened the red
box when the lights went out.

771
00:35:00,044 --> 00:35:02,742
- And you didn't say anything to them?
- Would you?

772
00:35:02,743 --> 00:35:04,375
No, I wouldn't.

773
00:35:04,376 --> 00:35:06,976
I think I would've thought I was
going to die, or something.

774
00:35:06,977 --> 00:35:08,909
Okay, okay. So, that's it?

775
00:35:08,910 --> 00:35:11,842
Well, that and there's
this weird zone...

776
00:35:11,843 --> 00:35:13,608
that's even darker
than the rest of it all.

777
00:35:13,609 --> 00:35:16,010
We went through that.

778
00:35:16,011 --> 00:35:17,842
We went through that
when we went down there.

779
00:35:17,843 --> 00:35:20,209
We need to find out
what's going on.

780
00:35:20,210 --> 00:35:22,242
- The Internet's down. We don't have...
- We can't just sit here.

781
00:35:22,243 --> 00:35:25,043
What else? Do you guys have any...

782
00:35:25,044 --> 00:35:26,909
Do you have books?

783
00:35:26,910 --> 00:35:28,342
Books on what? Books on comets?

784
00:35:28,343 --> 00:35:29,976
Comets, gravity, black holes...

785
00:35:29,977 --> 00:35:32,941
Yeah, I've got Shakespeare, some
Henry Miller and some screenplays.

786
00:35:32,942 --> 00:35:34,642
Dude, I'm a fucking actor.

787
00:35:34,643 --> 00:35:36,942
Anything about quantum physics?

788
00:35:36,943 --> 00:35:39,508
Yeah, that's right up my alley.

789
00:35:39,509 --> 00:35:41,975
Some actors read.

790
00:35:41,976 --> 00:35:45,309
Your brother left a book
at our house and...

791
00:35:45,310 --> 00:35:46,941
What?

792
00:35:46,942 --> 00:35:48,575
I put it in an envelope to mail,

793
00:35:48,576 --> 00:35:50,243
but I-I put it in your car.

794
00:35:50,244 --> 00:35:52,275
- And it's about?
- I don't know what it's about.

795
00:35:52,276 --> 00:35:53,943
- Comets?
- It's just one of his books.

796
00:35:53,944 --> 00:35:55,708
It's always about stuff like that.

797
00:35:55,709 --> 00:35:58,542
Yeah, I will... I will go get
the book I don't know about.

798
00:35:58,543 --> 00:36:01,776
Can somebody go with him?
Could you bring the bat?

799
00:36:01,777 --> 00:36:04,076
- Yeah.
- Yes. That's a good idea.

800
00:36:04,077 --> 00:36:07,409
Please be careful, babe.

801
00:36:07,410 --> 00:36:09,142
Okay.

802
00:36:09,143 --> 00:36:10,975
Should we wake up Lee?

803
00:36:10,976 --> 00:36:15,043
How could she go to sleep
in the middle of all this?

804
00:36:15,710 --> 00:36:18,745
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry, babe.

805
00:36:19,543 --> 00:36:21,508
Jesus.
Calm down, everybody.

806
00:36:21,509 --> 00:36:23,041
Oh, baby.

807
00:36:23,042 --> 00:36:25,983
I was gonna mail it back to him.

808
00:36:30,777 --> 00:36:32,375
What is it?

809
00:36:32,376 --> 00:36:36,075
"Gravitation: An Introduction
To Current Research."

810
00:36:36,076 --> 00:36:37,742
That's not gonna apply.

811
00:36:37,743 --> 00:36:40,708
So, is his brother like a
scientist, or something?

812
00:36:40,709 --> 00:36:42,209
He's just a really trippy guy.

813
00:36:42,210 --> 00:36:43,676
He's really, really smart,
a real egghead.

814
00:36:43,677 --> 00:36:47,242
But it's hard to... It's
like he thinks out loud.

815
00:36:47,243 --> 00:36:50,642
He's a teacher at U.C.S.D.
What do you got, Hugh?

816
00:36:50,643 --> 00:36:52,808
This is...

817
00:36:52,809 --> 00:36:56,842
These are Brian's notes from
his lesson plan for his class.

818
00:36:56,843 --> 00:37:00,476
"Decoherence and Schrodinger's
Cat." He talked about this.

819
00:37:00,477 --> 00:37:02,456
Do you guys know what
Schrodinger's cat is?

820
00:37:02,482 --> 00:37:04,009
I'm allergic.

821
00:37:04,010 --> 00:37:07,442
So, it's a, um...
It's a thought experiment.

822
00:37:07,443 --> 00:37:09,209
There's a...
There's a cat in a box...

823
00:37:09,210 --> 00:37:12,208
that has, like, a 50/50
chance of living...

824
00:37:12,209 --> 00:37:13,809
because there's a vial of poison...

825
00:37:13,810 --> 00:37:15,408
that's also in the box.

826
00:37:15,409 --> 00:37:18,974
So, regular physics would say
that it's one or the other.

827
00:37:18,975 --> 00:37:20,476
That the cat is
either alive or dead.

828
00:37:20,477 --> 00:37:23,308
But Brian would argue
that quantum physics says...

829
00:37:23,309 --> 00:37:26,274
that both realities
exist simultaneously.

830
00:37:26,275 --> 00:37:29,809
It's only when you open the
box that they collapse...

831
00:37:29,810 --> 00:37:31,909
into a single event.
Right?

832
00:37:31,910 --> 00:37:35,042
So, listen to this.
This is what he's written.

833
00:37:35,043 --> 00:37:36,742
"There is another theory:

834
00:37:36,743 --> 00:37:38,809
that two states
continue to exist...

835
00:37:38,810 --> 00:37:40,976
separate and decoherent
from each other,

836
00:37:40,977 --> 00:37:43,607
each creating a new
branch of reality...

837
00:37:43,608 --> 00:37:45,241
based on the two outcomes.

838
00:37:45,242 --> 00:37:48,274
Quantum decoherence ensures
that the different outcomes...

839
00:37:48,275 --> 00:37:51,076
have no interaction
with each other."

840
00:37:51,077 --> 00:37:53,341
- Hold on.
- Well, that explains it.

841
00:37:53,342 --> 00:37:58,008
So we're in the box.
We're the cat.

842
00:37:58,009 --> 00:38:00,809
We're both alive and dead.

843
00:38:00,810 --> 00:38:05,842
So, there are... There are two
separate realities, and...

844
00:38:05,843 --> 00:38:08,808
presumably until the comet passes.

845
00:38:08,809 --> 00:38:10,942
- Until the comet passes?
- Okay.

846
00:38:10,943 --> 00:38:14,842
Or decoherence is maintained and
those two separate realities...

847
00:38:14,843 --> 00:38:16,809
will remain separate
once the comet passes.

848
00:38:16,810 --> 00:38:18,309
Everybody will be fine.

849
00:38:18,310 --> 00:38:20,309
Decoherence keeps us separate.

850
00:38:20,310 --> 00:38:21,976
Right.

851
00:38:21,977 --> 00:38:25,742
Why are the other us contacting
us then in this way?

852
00:38:25,743 --> 00:38:27,275
They didn't want to.

853
00:38:27,276 --> 00:38:29,575
Who got the pictures?
Who... The numbers?

854
00:38:29,576 --> 00:38:33,177
We started it when we went
to find a house with lights.

855
00:38:33,178 --> 00:38:35,709
Yeah, maybe they didn't
mean the box for us.

856
00:38:35,710 --> 00:38:38,275
The box isn't for us.

857
00:38:38,276 --> 00:38:42,143
What if we've already
interacted with ourselves?

858
00:38:42,144 --> 00:38:44,876
So, we're collapsing on
ourselves right now.

859
00:38:44,877 --> 00:38:47,608
Not if we stay separate
from each other.

860
00:38:47,609 --> 00:38:49,909
It's already too late.
We've already been there.

861
00:38:49,910 --> 00:38:53,143
Do you remember that
movie Sliding Doors?

862
00:38:53,144 --> 00:38:56,242
Where just a fraction of a second...

863
00:38:56,243 --> 00:38:58,307
there could be two realities?

864
00:38:58,308 --> 00:39:01,275
In one, she runs and tries to get
on the subway and she can't.

865
00:39:01,276 --> 00:39:03,010
She gets her hand stuck in the door.

866
00:39:03,011 --> 00:39:04,674
In the other one, she gets
through and there's two...

867
00:39:04,675 --> 00:39:07,143
If we're collapsing right now,
I'm gonna collapse on them.

868
00:39:07,144 --> 00:39:08,875
I'm not gonna wait for
them to collapse on us.

869
00:39:08,876 --> 00:39:11,143
Whoa, whoa, Mike.

870
00:39:11,144 --> 00:39:13,108
I'll go over there and
I'll just kill 'em.

871
00:39:13,109 --> 00:39:15,841
- What?
- Half-kidding.

872
00:39:15,842 --> 00:39:17,308
- Mike, let's just...
- I love my fucking life.

873
00:39:17,309 --> 00:39:19,842
Let's be smart first before
we do anything stupid,

874
00:39:19,843 --> 00:39:21,342
and let's stick with
that we do know.

875
00:39:21,343 --> 00:39:24,241
And what's smart? Just
sitting here? Doing nothing?

876
00:39:24,242 --> 00:39:26,643
What we do know is that
we took this box. Right?

877
00:39:26,644 --> 00:39:29,140
So, our first act should
be to return it. Yes?

878
00:39:29,141 --> 00:39:31,108
Fuck that. No. We're not
returning that box.

879
00:39:31,109 --> 00:39:33,043
I don't trust that house.
That stays here.

880
00:39:33,044 --> 00:39:35,241
Wait, wait, wait.
What's got you so freaked out?

881
00:39:35,242 --> 00:39:37,975
- Stupid, stupid question.
- You're right.

882
00:39:37,976 --> 00:39:40,309
We're not at war with the
house down the street.

883
00:39:40,310 --> 00:39:43,541
They might literally be
the same people as us.

884
00:39:43,542 --> 00:39:45,474
Mike's saying come over
here and let's kill us.

885
00:39:45,475 --> 00:39:50,541
That's right. If you do it first,
you know who you're gonna fight?

886
00:39:50,542 --> 00:39:52,042
- Mike.
- You.

887
00:39:52,043 --> 00:39:54,745
You're gonna run into you.

888
00:39:55,543 --> 00:39:57,848
Who's gonna win that?

889
00:39:58,233 --> 00:40:00,810
Who did you see in the
window when you went there?

890
00:40:00,811 --> 00:40:02,709
- Did you see yourself?
- I did not see myself.

891
00:40:02,710 --> 00:40:04,274
- I told you who I saw.
- Okay, okay.

892
00:40:04,275 --> 00:40:08,942
But what if, in that over there,
that house, what if I'm drinking?

893
00:40:08,943 --> 00:40:12,193
I mean, just think
about that for a sec.

894
00:40:13,777 --> 00:40:15,808
That's a fucked-up Michael.

895
00:40:15,809 --> 00:40:18,009
Oh, God.

896
00:40:18,010 --> 00:40:19,808
I'm not gonna wait for a
fucking drunk Mike...

897
00:40:19,809 --> 00:40:21,307
to come over here and kill me.

898
00:40:21,308 --> 00:40:25,245
And kill you and kill
you and kill you.

899
00:40:27,043 --> 00:40:29,841
I'm not waiting for that.

900
00:40:29,842 --> 00:40:32,275
Wait, wait, wait a minute.

901
00:40:32,276 --> 00:40:34,208
Who did you see when you were there?

902
00:40:34,209 --> 00:40:39,742
I saw Amir, I saw Hugh,
and I saw Lee.

903
00:40:39,743 --> 00:40:41,608
Okay. Lee's not here right now.

904
00:40:41,609 --> 00:40:43,876
- She's taking a nap.
- What do you mean, she's taking a nap?

905
00:40:43,877 --> 00:40:46,808
- So, it's different, then.
- Something's off. It's not the same.

906
00:40:46,809 --> 00:40:48,308
In this reality, Lee's napping.

907
00:40:48,309 --> 00:40:51,107
Maybe in that reality,
you're napping?

908
00:40:51,108 --> 00:40:52,608
So, that's why Mike didn't see her.

909
00:40:52,609 --> 00:40:57,141
Right, and if Beth is
napping in that reality...

910
00:40:57,142 --> 00:40:58,776
they don't have the book.

911
00:40:58,777 --> 00:41:00,308
- They don't.
- Right.

912
00:41:00,309 --> 00:41:01,976
The other house doesn't
have the book.

913
00:41:01,977 --> 00:41:03,541
And if they don't have the book,

914
00:41:03,542 --> 00:41:07,307
they're not having this
conversation right now.

915
00:41:07,308 --> 00:41:10,041
So, then if we get the
book from the car...

916
00:41:10,042 --> 00:41:12,242
then we can avoid all this.

917
00:41:12,243 --> 00:41:16,820
- Take it? Take their book?
- It's a possibility.

918
00:41:16,821 --> 00:41:19,608
- Hugh, give me your keys.
- No, no, no. Wait, wait, wait.

919
00:41:19,609 --> 00:41:22,313
We're not supposed to
mess with any of this.

920
00:41:22,314 --> 00:41:23,909
Why would we even risk this?

921
00:41:23,910 --> 00:41:26,407
- He's talking about going over and fighting them.
- But why make it worse?

922
00:41:26,408 --> 00:41:28,708
Because then I don't have to
go over there and kill them.

923
00:41:28,709 --> 00:41:30,242
Just give me the keys.

924
00:41:30,243 --> 00:41:33,375
No. I don't think that
we should do anything.

925
00:41:33,376 --> 00:41:36,784
And you are not taking my keys.

926
00:41:42,577 --> 00:41:45,477
Where you going, Mike?

927
00:41:45,478 --> 00:41:50,575
How do we know it's exactly us?
What if it's just externals? What if...

928
00:41:50,576 --> 00:41:52,242
- The dark side of us.
- Yeah.

929
00:41:52,243 --> 00:41:55,675
It's us, you guys. You mean,
the not friendly versions?

930
00:41:55,676 --> 00:41:59,842
Well, if it's us, then this
could be... Is it a good thing?

931
00:41:59,843 --> 00:42:02,141
It sounds like it would
be a way to reach...

932
00:42:02,142 --> 00:42:03,841
higher consciousness,
if we want to...

933
00:42:03,842 --> 00:42:05,675
Like an acceptance of ourselves?

934
00:42:05,676 --> 00:42:08,742
Well, yeah. We always talk about meeting
ourselves and finding ourselves,

935
00:42:08,743 --> 00:42:10,208
and here we have an opportunity...

936
00:42:10,209 --> 00:42:12,809
to actually physically
find ourselves.

937
00:42:12,810 --> 00:42:14,341
That's a lot of pressure.

938
00:42:14,342 --> 00:42:17,108
- Look who's joined us.
- Hi, everybody.

939
00:42:17,109 --> 00:42:19,240
How are you, honey?
Okay.

940
00:42:19,241 --> 00:42:20,942
Welcome back to your
own dinner party.

941
00:42:20,943 --> 00:42:23,108
Yeah. How's my dinner party going?

942
00:42:23,109 --> 00:42:25,776
Super missed you.
It's going.

943
00:42:25,777 --> 00:42:27,274
I have an idea.

944
00:42:27,275 --> 00:42:29,341
I have an idea that
will prevent them...

945
00:42:29,342 --> 00:42:31,342
from getting the book from the car.

946
00:42:31,343 --> 00:42:33,208
What are you talking about, man?

947
00:42:33,209 --> 00:42:36,040
I'm gonna go to that house,
and I'm gonna blackmail myself.

948
00:42:36,041 --> 00:42:38,142
I'm gonna leave a
note to keep Mike...

949
00:42:38,143 --> 00:42:40,141
from having them go to
the car to get that book.

950
00:42:40,142 --> 00:42:42,007
What do you mean, a blackmail note?

951
00:42:42,008 --> 00:42:43,709
Something I know that
I don't want revealed.

952
00:42:43,710 --> 00:42:45,341
What are you talking about?

953
00:42:45,342 --> 00:42:46,909
The thing with Beth.

954
00:42:46,910 --> 00:42:48,575
The thing with Beth?

955
00:42:48,576 --> 00:42:50,908
I thought you and Hugh
worked that out years ago.

956
00:42:50,909 --> 00:42:53,141
This is the worst
idea I've ever heard.

957
00:42:53,142 --> 00:42:55,007
It's amazing, 'cause
it would work on me.

958
00:42:55,008 --> 00:42:57,309
- Going over there...
- It's the same person.

959
00:42:57,310 --> 00:42:58,974
We don't...
You don't know that.

960
00:42:58,975 --> 00:43:00,808
This will pass.
It's brilliant.

961
00:43:00,809 --> 00:43:02,541
- No. It is not brilliant.
- It's brilliant.

962
00:43:02,542 --> 00:43:05,308
Dude, no. I know this
look in your eye.

963
00:43:05,309 --> 00:43:07,509
Mike, no.

964
00:43:07,510 --> 00:43:09,408
Why would he even say that?

965
00:43:09,409 --> 00:43:12,407
Divergence. Otherwise,
it's just the same people.

966
00:43:12,476 --> 00:43:14,107
And if it's the same people,

967
00:43:14,108 --> 00:43:16,109
then why not just leave
each other alone?

968
00:43:16,110 --> 00:43:17,876
That's what I would want me to do.

969
00:43:17,877 --> 00:43:19,474
That might be the best thing to do.

970
00:43:19,475 --> 00:43:21,274
Right?
You doing okay?

971
00:43:21,275 --> 00:43:22,708
Yeah, yeah.

972
00:43:22,709 --> 00:43:26,908
I don't know if I'm woozy from
the drops or if it's like...

973
00:43:26,909 --> 00:43:28,742
- What drops?
- What drops?

974
00:43:28,743 --> 00:43:31,041
- Um...
- Did you give her...

975
00:43:31,042 --> 00:43:33,576
Yeah, well.
She wanted to take...

976
00:43:33,577 --> 00:43:36,442
I just felt so weird before.

977
00:43:36,443 --> 00:43:40,641
- It's this stuff I brought, this rescue remedy.
- What is it?

978
00:43:40,642 --> 00:43:45,276
It's got echinacea, golden seal,
passion flower and a little ketamine.

979
00:43:45,277 --> 00:43:47,842
I swear to God.

980
00:43:47,843 --> 00:43:49,542
- Ketamine?
- A little ketamine?

981
00:43:49,543 --> 00:43:52,107
- It's not like you're going to go into this...
- Beth.

982
00:43:52,108 --> 00:43:56,007
- What?
- I'm so sorry if I'm wrong here...

983
00:43:56,008 --> 00:43:59,142
and I'm saying something
incredibly inappropriate.

984
00:43:59,143 --> 00:44:01,940
What?

985
00:44:01,941 --> 00:44:05,442
Did you put any of that in the food?

986
00:44:05,443 --> 00:44:07,741
Yes. That would explain a lot.
Lee asked me for some.

987
00:44:07,742 --> 00:44:09,375
Oh, come on, Amir.

988
00:44:09,376 --> 00:44:10,841
Are you serious?

989
00:44:10,842 --> 00:44:13,374
I had to ask.

990
00:44:13,375 --> 00:44:16,007
She asked to take some
and I gave her some.

991
00:44:16,008 --> 00:44:18,308
When we did the mushrooms years ago,

992
00:44:18,309 --> 00:44:22,641
we talked about it, and I put
them in the spaghetti sauce.

993
00:44:22,642 --> 00:44:24,175
That was a group decision.

994
00:44:24,176 --> 00:44:26,242
I know we agreed,
but I had to ask because...

995
00:44:26,243 --> 00:44:29,586
You think that I would just
put drugs in your food?

996
00:44:29,587 --> 00:44:30,341
Oh, my God.

997
00:44:30,342 --> 00:44:32,209
Okay. I'll show you.

998
00:44:32,210 --> 00:44:34,274
On top of all this,
you think I'd drug you?

999
00:44:34,275 --> 00:44:36,874
I'll show you. Let's just
see how much is in there.

1000
00:44:36,875 --> 00:44:39,642
This is the vial I brought.

1001
00:44:39,643 --> 00:44:41,142
Yeah, and a quarter of it is gone.

1002
00:44:41,143 --> 00:44:43,743
But that's... She's had a
couple of drops out of it.

1003
00:44:43,744 --> 00:44:46,840
- That's it.
- This is, like, high-grade pharmaceutical...

1004
00:44:46,841 --> 00:44:48,907
It is watered down.
You can't.

1005
00:44:48,908 --> 00:44:50,374
You opened it up and
watered it down?

1006
00:44:50,375 --> 00:44:52,107
Okay, but if you took enough of it,

1007
00:44:52,108 --> 00:44:53,841
isn't it true that you
would have hallucinations?

1008
00:44:53,842 --> 00:44:55,341
You would have to
have a massive dose.

1009
00:44:55,342 --> 00:44:57,175
You would have to take
the entire bottle.

1010
00:44:57,176 --> 00:44:59,744
Okay. Fine.
But is it true?

1011
00:45:00,410 --> 00:45:02,242
Yes. Okay. And is it also true...

1012
00:45:02,243 --> 00:45:04,575
that one of the other
effects can be paranoia?

1013
00:45:04,576 --> 00:45:07,308
Yes, but you...

1014
00:45:07,309 --> 00:45:08,974
Again, you would have to have all of it.

1015
00:45:08,975 --> 00:45:11,141
The whole bottle. The whole bottle.
And it would never...

1016
00:45:11,142 --> 00:45:14,409
Even if all of us
took a bottle each,

1017
00:45:14,410 --> 00:45:16,741
it would never create
a mass hallucination.

1018
00:45:16,742 --> 00:45:20,407
- I'm not a criminal.
- It would be a nice conclusion right now.

1019
00:45:20,408 --> 00:45:22,508
Wouldn't this be great if
we were hallucinating?

1020
00:45:22,509 --> 00:45:25,174
- Well, it's not the explanation.
- Fine.

1021
00:45:25,175 --> 00:45:28,874
- I believe you.
- This is the bottle.

1022
00:45:28,875 --> 00:45:31,008
- She asked for it. I gave her some.
- Okay.

1023
00:45:31,009 --> 00:45:33,142
I-I did not drug your food.

1024
00:45:33,143 --> 00:45:35,207
- I did not drug your food.
- I...

1025
00:45:35,208 --> 00:45:37,907
- Get it?
- Lay off, okay?

1026
00:45:37,908 --> 00:45:40,608
I swear to God.

1027
00:45:40,609 --> 00:45:42,807
Thanks.

1028
00:45:45,510 --> 00:45:48,008
Hey, where'd you get this?
This is so cute.

1029
00:45:48,009 --> 00:45:50,174
Oh, I got it at, Galaxy.
That thrift store.

1030
00:45:50,175 --> 00:45:51,875
Oh, I love that place.

1031
00:45:51,876 --> 00:45:53,775
- That's great.
- They have such cute stuff.

1032
00:45:53,776 --> 00:45:56,375
I just...
I need a drink.

1033
00:45:56,376 --> 00:45:57,807
Yeah.

1034
00:45:57,808 --> 00:46:00,875
Okay.

1035
00:46:00,876 --> 00:46:05,842
I just want to wake up and
start again, you know?

1036
00:46:19,342 --> 00:46:22,508
Blue.

1037
00:46:22,509 --> 00:46:24,075
It's not even cracked.

1038
00:46:24,076 --> 00:46:26,274
What are we gonna do?

1039
00:46:26,275 --> 00:46:28,442
We have to get the fuck out of here.

1040
00:46:28,443 --> 00:46:30,174
Okay.

1041
00:46:30,175 --> 00:46:31,942
- Okay. Let's take...
- Take the book.

1042
00:46:31,943 --> 00:46:33,441
- Take the book.
- Do we take the box?

1043
00:46:33,442 --> 00:46:36,707
- Take the box. This is what they...
- Take it.

1044
00:46:36,708 --> 00:46:40,575
Hey. You okay?

1045
00:46:40,576 --> 00:46:43,041
Where'd you go?

1046
00:46:43,042 --> 00:46:44,840
I need a drink.

1047
00:46:44,841 --> 00:46:48,840
Hey. What...
Where'd you go?

1048
00:46:48,841 --> 00:46:50,542
I went to the house, dude.

1049
00:46:50,543 --> 00:46:53,108
- I told you.
- What happened?

1050
00:46:53,109 --> 00:46:55,142
I just dropped the letter off.

1051
00:46:55,143 --> 00:46:59,408
I saw the book.

1052
00:46:59,409 --> 00:47:03,007
I was gonna... I was gonna
smash the window...

1053
00:47:03,008 --> 00:47:04,542
and take the book.

1054
00:47:04,543 --> 00:47:07,108
I didn't do that, though.
I did not do that.

1055
00:47:07,109 --> 00:47:10,576
I just dropped off the
letter, and, um...

1056
00:47:10,577 --> 00:47:15,673
then I was gonna wait,
to see their reaction.

1057
00:47:15,674 --> 00:47:17,542
But I fuckin' freaked out.

1058
00:47:17,543 --> 00:47:19,475
- You've been gone, like, five minutes.
- Like 45 minutes, dude.

1059
00:47:19,476 --> 00:47:21,141
- No. No. You talked to me.
- Bullshit.

1060
00:47:21,142 --> 00:47:22,842
You went in the kitchen.

1061
00:47:22,843 --> 00:47:26,142
You've been gone for
five, maybe 10 tops.

1062
00:47:26,143 --> 00:47:29,511
You're fuckin' crazy.

1063
00:47:30,309 --> 00:47:35,119
Oh, Mike.
Mike, don't do that.

1064
00:47:43,909 --> 00:47:45,940
- Oh, my God.
- Mike, what was...

1065
00:47:45,941 --> 00:47:47,741
Don't do this.

1066
00:47:47,742 --> 00:47:50,740
Mike, please?
Why now?

1067
00:47:50,741 --> 00:47:54,479
Why not now, honey?
Why not now?

1068
00:47:55,118 --> 00:47:57,642
- Where are Hugh and...
- We were in the kitchen.

1069
00:47:57,643 --> 00:47:59,675
Where's...

1070
00:47:59,676 --> 00:48:02,675
- Where's Hugh?
- Where's Amir?

1071
00:48:02,676 --> 00:48:05,242
More importantly, where's the box?

1072
00:48:05,243 --> 00:48:07,041
Oh, my God.
They took the box.

1073
00:48:07,042 --> 00:48:08,707
Mike, where did they go?

1074
00:48:08,708 --> 00:48:11,608
I have no clue where they went.
You gotta be kidding.

1075
00:48:11,609 --> 00:48:13,241
You were in here.
What happened?

1076
00:48:13,242 --> 00:48:16,842
Where's the book?
Where's the book?

1077
00:48:16,843 --> 00:48:19,509
Why would they bring
that to the other house?

1078
00:48:19,510 --> 00:48:23,208
They said they wanted to take it back
so they could make everything right.

1079
00:48:23,209 --> 00:48:25,908
They wanted to return it, so everything
would be fine from the beginning, but...

1080
00:48:25,909 --> 00:48:29,075
Why would they bring the book? It's
the one thing that we wouldn't...

1081
00:48:29,076 --> 00:48:32,940
- They took everything we have.
- Wait a minute.

1082
00:48:32,941 --> 00:48:34,508
We have to go get them.

1083
00:48:34,509 --> 00:48:36,875
Wait a minute. They were the
first ones to leave, right?

1084
00:48:36,876 --> 00:48:39,707
And then they... They came back.
They said they saw something.

1085
00:48:39,708 --> 00:48:41,307
They've been acting
weird ever since.

1086
00:48:41,308 --> 00:48:46,375
What are you implying?
Oh, my God.

1087
00:48:46,376 --> 00:48:49,075
- No, that's... Well, you guys left, too.
- Think about it.

1088
00:48:49,076 --> 00:48:50,808
I mean, everyone...
You left, too.

1089
00:48:50,809 --> 00:48:52,541
Amir came back and got
so quiet, Come on.

1090
00:48:52,542 --> 00:48:54,309
And then...
and he didn't...

1091
00:48:54,310 --> 00:48:56,274
- Amir was being totally weird.
- I'll bring 'em back.

1092
00:48:56,275 --> 00:48:58,142
- I'll see what's going on.
- Baby, you're not...

1093
00:48:58,143 --> 00:48:59,741
- You're not going anywhere.
- I'll be back.

1094
00:48:59,742 --> 00:49:01,707
I'm just gonna go
bring them back...

1095
00:49:01,708 --> 00:49:03,175
and find out what
the hell's going on.

1096
00:49:03,176 --> 00:49:05,207
- No. You're not leaving.
- Baby, relax. What?

1097
00:49:05,208 --> 00:49:06,841
- No.
- It's fine. I'll be back.

1098
00:49:06,842 --> 00:49:11,542
I'm not gonna let you go.

1099
00:49:11,543 --> 00:49:15,249
It would be fucking crazy.

1100
00:49:20,043 --> 00:49:21,819
Okay. So, what are we gonna do?

1101
00:49:21,820 --> 00:49:25,175
I mean, they're out there, and I swear
to God, I'm gonna have a heart attack.

1102
00:49:25,176 --> 00:49:27,008
- We've gotta do something.
- Let's have a drink.

1103
00:49:27,009 --> 00:49:28,774
We don't even know if that was them.

1104
00:49:28,775 --> 00:49:30,607
Would you quit saying that, please?

1105
00:49:30,608 --> 00:49:32,741
No, but if it wasn't them,
then Mike is right,

1106
00:49:32,742 --> 00:49:34,274
and we can't trust the other house.

1107
00:49:34,275 --> 00:49:35,975
- We can't trust ourselves.
- That's right.

1108
00:49:35,976 --> 00:49:40,779
- Jesus.
- And our clues just left the house.

1109
00:49:42,576 --> 00:49:45,574
No. Wait.

1110
00:49:45,575 --> 00:49:49,207
The clues are still here.

1111
00:49:49,208 --> 00:49:51,708
If they had the pictures, then...

1112
00:49:51,709 --> 00:49:54,142
Mike, you took that picture
of me and Kevin. Right?

1113
00:49:54,143 --> 00:49:57,108
Do you have it here?

1114
00:49:57,109 --> 00:50:00,241
I-I can't take this anymore.
I can't take it.

1115
00:50:00,242 --> 00:50:04,018
- Sweetheart...
- Can you at least go look for it?

1116
00:50:05,109 --> 00:50:08,858
I'm gonna look for
another bottle of wine.

1117
00:50:24,641 --> 00:50:27,604
This is so stupid.

1118
00:50:27,605 --> 00:50:29,341
Should I be keeping an eye on him?

1119
00:50:29,342 --> 00:50:32,540
I feel like I don't
want to hover, and...

1120
00:50:32,541 --> 00:50:36,810
I don't know.

1121
00:50:37,608 --> 00:50:40,877
Just give it a minute, and then...

1122
00:50:41,675 --> 00:50:44,505
go in and talk to him, I guess.

1123
00:50:46,075 --> 00:50:49,608
I don't know who Mike is anymore.
Not when he drinks.

1124
00:50:49,609 --> 00:50:52,309
Everything that's gone wrong with us
started when he started drinking.

1125
00:50:52,310 --> 00:50:54,075
It's why we had to leave L.A.

1126
00:50:54,076 --> 00:50:55,975
It's why he doesn't have a career.

1127
00:50:55,976 --> 00:50:58,575
He's just...
I don't know.

1128
00:50:58,576 --> 00:51:01,633
Not the man I married.

1129
00:52:02,309 --> 00:52:03,974
Hey.

1130
00:52:03,975 --> 00:52:06,075
- Hey.
- How you doing?

1131
00:52:06,076 --> 00:52:08,674
How you holding up?

1132
00:52:08,675 --> 00:52:10,974
All things considered, all right.

1133
00:52:10,975 --> 00:52:13,373
I totally don't believe you.

1134
00:52:13,374 --> 00:52:15,408
Yeah. Well, am I being
some... What's going on?

1135
00:52:15,409 --> 00:52:17,209
I... Amir told me you were
gonna go to Vietnam...

1136
00:52:17,210 --> 00:52:18,807
and Em's not going with you?

1137
00:52:18,808 --> 00:52:20,807
Yeah. I...

1138
00:52:20,808 --> 00:52:22,707
I gotta go for work
for, I don't know...

1139
00:52:22,708 --> 00:52:24,942
It's four months, I think, and,

1140
00:52:24,943 --> 00:52:26,975
yeah, I want her to
come along, but...

1141
00:52:26,976 --> 00:52:28,474
She'd be crazy not to go with you.

1142
00:52:28,475 --> 00:52:30,675
Yeah. That's what I think.

1143
00:52:30,676 --> 00:52:32,374
Yeah. I don't...
I don't know.

1144
00:52:32,375 --> 00:52:34,508
I mean, it's... I-I really
don't want to interfere.

1145
00:52:34,509 --> 00:52:36,174
It doesn't seem like
any of my business,

1146
00:52:36,175 --> 00:52:38,841
but I think you've
always been someone...

1147
00:52:38,842 --> 00:52:42,275
who's extremely passionate about
your life and what you're doing,

1148
00:52:42,276 --> 00:52:45,208
and if you have a partner that
seems to hesitate all the time,

1149
00:52:45,209 --> 00:52:49,475
with things of life, I don't know
if that's gonna make you happy.

1150
00:52:49,476 --> 00:52:51,941
Oh. She's...

1151
00:52:51,942 --> 00:52:54,675
I mean, I love her, and...
It's just who she is.

1152
00:52:54,676 --> 00:52:58,641
- Sometimes she's a little...
- Tall?

1153
00:53:00,243 --> 00:53:02,339
- Crazy.
- She's a little bit tall.

1154
00:53:02,340 --> 00:53:04,674
I mean, do you have to stand
on your tiptoes to kiss her?

1155
00:53:04,675 --> 00:53:07,873
I...

1156
00:53:10,575 --> 00:53:12,807
Sometimes people just fit well.

1157
00:53:12,808 --> 00:53:15,875
Laurie...
Like that Sharks game?

1158
00:53:15,876 --> 00:53:19,040
Come on, you can't tell
me we don't fit well.

1159
00:53:19,041 --> 00:53:21,740
I had to do yoga for a week
afterwards to recover.

1160
00:53:21,741 --> 00:53:24,741
I do remember that.

1161
00:53:24,742 --> 00:53:29,778
I just think that maybe...

1162
00:53:32,574 --> 00:53:34,508
Laurie.

1163
00:53:34,509 --> 00:53:37,527
I'm sorry. I'm crossing all
kinds of boundaries with you.

1164
00:53:37,528 --> 00:53:39,582
Yeah.

1165
00:53:48,841 --> 00:53:51,975
Baby?
Hi.

1166
00:53:51,976 --> 00:53:55,407
You know, I think you're right...

1167
00:53:55,408 --> 00:53:58,911
that everything
happens for a reason.

1168
00:54:05,175 --> 00:54:08,374
Should I get the bat?

1169
00:54:08,375 --> 00:54:10,642
For you or for me?

1170
00:54:10,643 --> 00:54:13,245
Could be either.

1171
00:54:15,042 --> 00:54:17,440
What are we doing here?

1172
00:54:17,441 --> 00:54:23,520
If I'm losing it over
there, I'm losing it here.

1173
00:54:23,521 --> 00:54:25,941
It doesn't have to be like that.
Sure, it does.

1174
00:54:25,942 --> 00:54:28,008
It's the same thing.

1175
00:54:28,009 --> 00:54:30,508
No, it's not.

1176
00:54:30,509 --> 00:54:33,241
How do you figure?

1177
00:54:33,242 --> 00:54:38,041
Because there's no way that anybody
over there, or... or anywhere,

1178
00:54:38,042 --> 00:54:43,015
loves you as much as I
love you right here.

1179
00:54:47,809 --> 00:54:52,551
I fucked up.

1180
00:55:00,342 --> 00:55:02,907
Hi.
Hey.

1181
00:55:02,908 --> 00:55:06,742
How you doing?

1182
00:55:06,743 --> 00:55:11,407
Fine.

1183
00:55:11,408 --> 00:55:14,108
Is... Is everything okay?

1184
00:55:14,109 --> 00:55:18,341
Is there something going on?

1185
00:55:18,342 --> 00:55:22,641
Beth just walked up to me and...

1186
00:55:22,642 --> 00:55:27,041
she didn't really say much,
but she said that she...

1187
00:55:27,042 --> 00:55:31,232
saw you and Laurie talk
in the hallway, and...

1188
00:55:31,233 --> 00:55:33,075
Jesus Christ, Em.
I think we have...

1189
00:55:33,076 --> 00:55:35,040
some more important things
to worry about right now...

1190
00:55:35,041 --> 00:55:38,546
than what Beth is saying.

1191
00:55:41,342 --> 00:55:43,573
Jesus Christ.

1192
00:55:43,574 --> 00:55:45,908
Are you kidding me? That
would be the generator.

1193
00:55:45,909 --> 00:55:48,441
- Hold on.
- All right. You know what to do.

1194
00:55:48,442 --> 00:55:50,508
- We have thousands of matches at home.
- Don't burn yourself.

1195
00:55:50,509 --> 00:55:52,841
- Kevin, do you have matches?
- Yeah, I got some.

1196
00:55:52,842 --> 00:55:55,008
Here.

1197
00:55:55,009 --> 00:55:56,641
- Hold it.
- I don't know...

1198
00:55:56,642 --> 00:55:58,975
- You want to put this on the table?
- Yeah. Yeah.

1199
00:55:58,976 --> 00:56:01,173
That was right out front.

1200
00:56:01,174 --> 00:56:03,341
- Are you kidding?
- That sounds like one of our cars.

1201
00:56:03,342 --> 00:56:05,074
Like one of our cars
getting broken into.

1202
00:56:05,075 --> 00:56:06,740
Look, I'm going out there.
I can't stand this.

1203
00:56:06,741 --> 00:56:09,174
- I'm gonna go see what's going on.
- Not without the rest of us.

1204
00:56:09,175 --> 00:56:12,074
- Let's just all go.
- Fine. Then let's all go, but I'm going.

1205
00:56:12,075 --> 00:56:13,807
- I'll get my coat.
- I don't think we should.

1206
00:56:13,808 --> 00:56:15,474
- Let's get a flashlight.
- We'll be fine.

1207
00:56:15,475 --> 00:56:17,541
- Here. I got one here.
- You guys lead, okay?

1208
00:56:17,542 --> 00:56:19,074
- You ready?
- Okay. Here we go.

1209
00:56:19,075 --> 00:56:20,875
- Stay close. Stay close.
- Here we go.

1210
00:56:20,876 --> 00:56:24,779
- Where did it come from?
- I don't know.

1211
00:56:28,574 --> 00:56:30,773
That's it, right?

1212
00:56:32,476 --> 00:56:36,306
Oh, my God.
Jesus. Look.

1213
00:56:36,307 --> 00:56:40,241
- Is there anything in there?
- I don't see anything.

1214
00:56:40,242 --> 00:56:42,874
Oh, my God.
Should we...

1215
00:56:42,875 --> 00:56:44,974
- Should we check our cars?
- That's crazy.

1216
00:56:44,975 --> 00:56:46,541
Yeah, why doesn't everybody
check their own car.

1217
00:56:46,542 --> 00:56:48,675
- See if we find anything else.
- Let's look at our cars.

1218
00:56:48,676 --> 00:56:50,973
- Okay.
- All right. After you.

1219
00:56:50,974 --> 00:56:54,308
Is everyone nearby?

1220
00:56:54,309 --> 00:56:58,575
We shouldn't spread out too much.

1221
00:57:15,041 --> 00:57:17,506
- Hey.
- Everything okay?

1222
00:57:17,507 --> 00:57:21,073
Yeah. I just...

1223
00:57:21,074 --> 00:57:26,007
put this ring on that
you got me at the fair.

1224
00:57:26,008 --> 00:57:28,374
Remember?
I know it's...

1225
00:57:28,375 --> 00:57:31,208
I know it's cheesy, but I
just wanted to have it on.

1226
00:57:31,209 --> 00:57:33,273
Cheeseball.

1227
00:57:33,274 --> 00:57:37,540
- It was a good day.
- It was a good day.

1228
00:57:37,541 --> 00:57:39,908
Are we okay?

1229
00:57:39,909 --> 00:57:43,875
- Yeah, babe.
- After that whole Laurie thing?

1230
00:57:43,876 --> 00:57:46,040
Yeah.

1231
00:57:46,041 --> 00:57:47,842
I don't know what the
hell she's thinking,

1232
00:57:47,843 --> 00:57:50,875
but yeah, we're good.

1233
00:57:50,876 --> 00:57:54,948
Come here. Hey.

1234
00:57:58,743 --> 00:58:01,274
Is everything okay with Hugh's car?

1235
00:58:01,275 --> 00:58:06,140
- What do you mean?
- Well, did they take anything?

1236
00:58:06,141 --> 00:58:10,237
You just checked on his car.
Did they take anything?

1237
00:58:38,008 --> 00:58:40,173
Doesn't make any sense at all.

1238
00:58:40,174 --> 00:58:42,707
Do you think it's just someone
trying to intimidate us?

1239
00:58:42,708 --> 00:58:44,240
Intimidate? No.
I... It's...

1240
00:58:44,241 --> 00:58:46,573
None of this...
It doesn't...

1241
00:58:46,574 --> 00:58:49,807
I mean, it's like they're
looking for something, and...

1242
00:58:49,808 --> 00:58:53,041
- But there's nothing in there.
- Exactly. There's nothing in there. So, why...

1243
00:58:53,042 --> 00:58:54,507
They could see that
there's nothing in there.

1244
00:58:54,508 --> 00:58:56,474
- We could see that there's nothing in there.
- I know.

1245
00:58:56,475 --> 00:58:59,074
Why break the window
if there's nothing there?

1246
00:58:59,075 --> 00:59:02,475
- That doesn't make any sense.
- None of this makes any sense.

1247
00:59:02,476 --> 00:59:04,006
Where were you?

1248
00:59:04,007 --> 00:59:07,441
I went and got this ring.

1249
00:59:07,442 --> 00:59:11,605
Nice.

1250
00:59:11,606 --> 00:59:13,341
All right, hold on.
Let's-Let's...

1251
00:59:13,342 --> 00:59:16,340
Let's just try and figure out...

1252
00:59:16,341 --> 00:59:22,307
why we would break into
a car... Hugh's car...

1253
00:59:22,308 --> 00:59:24,575
knowing that the book wasn't there.

1254
00:59:24,576 --> 00:59:26,540
Well, we're assuming that
the book is the motive.

1255
00:59:26,541 --> 00:59:29,441
What if the motive is
completely different?

1256
00:59:29,442 --> 00:59:31,374
- Did you hear something?
- What the hell is that?

1257
00:59:31,375 --> 00:59:33,140
It's outside. No, Mike,
Mike, Mike, Mike.

1258
00:59:33,141 --> 00:59:36,708
- Oh, shit! There's someone coming.
- What?

1259
00:59:36,709 --> 00:59:38,742
They're coming over here, guys.

1260
00:59:38,743 --> 00:59:40,640
Yeah. It's Hugh.

1261
00:59:40,641 --> 00:59:42,441
- Is it Hugh?
- Is it Hugh and Amir?

1262
00:59:42,442 --> 00:59:45,141
Yeah, it's blue.
It's Hugh and Amir. Cool.

1263
00:59:45,142 --> 00:59:47,675
- They're coming to the door.
- Are you sure?

1264
00:59:47,676 --> 00:59:50,906
- It looks like it.
- Oh, baby.

1265
00:59:50,907 --> 00:59:52,641
Are you all okay?

1266
00:59:52,642 --> 00:59:56,074
Hey, where have you been?
What happened? Okay.

1267
00:59:56,075 --> 00:59:59,340
What have you been... Why did
you take... What did you do?

1268
00:59:59,341 --> 01:00:02,374
- Can you please tell us what happened?
- We went to...

1269
01:00:02,375 --> 01:00:05,340
We went to make a phone
call, and then when...

1270
01:00:05,341 --> 01:00:07,307
when we looked in
the door, we saw...

1271
01:00:07,308 --> 01:00:11,540
We saw this, basically.
I, I got startled.

1272
01:00:11,541 --> 01:00:14,206
I fell over. I hit my head.
We went back to the house to...

1273
01:00:14,207 --> 01:00:16,307
Wait. You already
came back here.

1274
01:00:16,308 --> 01:00:18,108
We already heard this story.

1275
01:00:18,109 --> 01:00:19,941
Why are you telling
us this story again?

1276
01:00:19,942 --> 01:00:21,541
- You came back with the box.
- Wait. What?

1277
01:00:21,542 --> 01:00:23,641
Because you came back,
and after you hit your head...

1278
01:00:23,642 --> 01:00:26,992
We gave him a Band-Aid
and you gave us the...

1279
01:00:26,993 --> 01:00:28,641
But not that Band-Aid.

1280
01:00:28,642 --> 01:00:32,407
- What do you mean?
- Oh, my God. I gave you a cloth Band-Aid.

1281
01:00:32,408 --> 01:00:35,774
Wait a minute. Hugh... There
was a Hugh and an Amir here?

1282
01:00:35,775 --> 01:00:37,641
Yes. And you left with the book.

1283
01:00:37,642 --> 01:00:40,406
You left with the pictures, and
we didn't know where you went.

1284
01:00:40,407 --> 01:00:42,940
We were at a house where
everybody had red glowsticks.

1285
01:00:42,941 --> 01:00:45,541
- You had red glowsticks.
- Do you understand?

1286
01:00:45,542 --> 01:00:49,540
We... We have red glow... We
took them from the other house.

1287
01:00:49,541 --> 01:00:51,640
- Right.
- Look. Look.

1288
01:00:51,641 --> 01:00:54,906
Is that... Look. That box of
red glowsticks is unopened.

1289
01:00:54,907 --> 01:00:58,006
Guys, if they started
here, they belong here.

1290
01:00:58,007 --> 01:01:00,241
They're in the right house.

1291
01:01:00,242 --> 01:01:03,074
- Well, welcome back.
- Welcome back.

1292
01:01:03,075 --> 01:01:05,707
- Jeez, man, I'm sorry.
- That's all right.

1293
01:01:05,708 --> 01:01:07,740
Sorry.

1294
01:01:07,741 --> 01:01:11,974
So, guys, what was the other
Mike like? What was he doing?

1295
01:01:11,975 --> 01:01:16,576
The other Mike is...
He's worried about you.

1296
01:01:17,303 --> 01:01:19,407
So, it was you guys
who left us the note.

1297
01:01:19,408 --> 01:01:23,041
No, I never got out with that note.

1298
01:01:23,042 --> 01:01:24,872
We ended up with two notes.

1299
01:01:24,873 --> 01:01:26,906
And so did we.

1300
01:01:26,907 --> 01:01:28,741
Well, where's... We have two notes.

1301
01:01:28,742 --> 01:01:33,107
One that was written here and
one that was left on the door.

1302
01:01:33,108 --> 01:01:36,408
If you didn't, and if
the other Hugh didn't,

1303
01:01:36,409 --> 01:01:39,606
then who has been
leaving the notes?

1304
01:01:39,607 --> 01:01:42,907
"Quantum decoherence ensures
that the different outcomes...

1305
01:01:42,908 --> 01:01:45,240
have no interaction
with one another."

1306
01:01:45,241 --> 01:01:47,840
So, that one note has been
written at least four times.

1307
01:01:47,841 --> 01:01:52,091
Well, how many Hugh and Amirs
are walking around out there?

1308
01:01:53,709 --> 01:01:55,241
Okay, before we do anything,

1309
01:01:55,242 --> 01:01:58,274
we have to figure out how
to mark our own house.

1310
01:01:58,275 --> 01:02:00,807
Just stay inside. No, no.
She's right.

1311
01:02:00,808 --> 01:02:03,307
Staying inside isn't realistic.

1312
01:02:03,308 --> 01:02:06,308
We need some kind of marker.
We got to mark this house.

1313
01:02:06,309 --> 01:02:08,007
If every house is the same...

1314
01:02:08,008 --> 01:02:10,141
If we put a marker in
front of the house,

1315
01:02:10,142 --> 01:02:12,173
there could be an infinite
number of houses with that mark.

1316
01:02:12,174 --> 01:02:14,006
So, we have to do something random.

1317
01:02:14,007 --> 01:02:15,474
Something that can't be repeated.
Something unique.

1318
01:02:15,475 --> 01:02:17,839
Dice. Do we have dice?
We have dice?

1319
01:02:17,840 --> 01:02:21,841
- Um, Yahtzee.
- Yeah, Yahtzee.

1320
01:02:21,842 --> 01:02:25,940
If we each roll a number for each
of us, that's what? That's...

1321
01:02:25,941 --> 01:02:28,940
Six times six times six times six
times... That's hugely random.

1322
01:02:28,941 --> 01:02:32,742
- The probability of that repeating is... tiny.
- And then what? We...

1323
01:02:32,743 --> 01:02:35,241
But so we have to have
something visual.

1324
01:02:35,242 --> 01:02:37,419
I mean, should we write
it down, put it in...

1325
01:02:37,420 --> 01:02:39,173
put it outside? Put it in an envelope?

1326
01:02:39,174 --> 01:02:40,807
We still won't know.
No, no, no, no.

1327
01:02:40,808 --> 01:02:42,473
We need something to mark it.

1328
01:02:42,474 --> 01:02:45,674
Yeah. We put it in a box.

1329
01:02:45,675 --> 01:02:47,740
- That's, that's...
- That's exactly what they've done.

1330
01:02:47,741 --> 01:02:50,407
- They were ahead of us.
- They were making a marker for their house.

1331
01:02:50,408 --> 01:02:52,806
They made a unique mark.
Only we took it.

1332
01:02:52,807 --> 01:02:54,773
If it seems like a good idea to us,

1333
01:02:54,774 --> 01:02:56,274
it would seem like a
good idea to them.

1334
01:02:56,275 --> 01:02:59,541
- Do you have a box?
- Yeah. Yeah, let me look.

1335
01:02:59,542 --> 01:03:01,374
So, we need photos.

1336
01:03:01,375 --> 01:03:04,308
This is so crazy.
It's par for the night.

1337
01:03:04,309 --> 01:03:06,641
- There are a lot of pictures here.
- You can't use that picture.

1338
01:03:06,642 --> 01:03:08,641
That's ridiculous.

1339
01:03:08,642 --> 01:03:11,907
- I'm the attorney for Grizzly Adams.
- Yeah, I know. This is...

1340
01:03:11,908 --> 01:03:13,740
I'm never hiring you.

1341
01:03:13,741 --> 01:03:16,740
How does this work as a box?

1342
01:03:16,741 --> 01:03:18,440
I didn't even know we had it.

1343
01:03:18,441 --> 01:03:20,974
It was just under a pile
of crap in the back.

1344
01:03:20,975 --> 01:03:22,772
If you can...
That'll work.

1345
01:03:22,773 --> 01:03:25,006
So, tha... Tha... That's your box?

1346
01:03:25,007 --> 01:03:28,139
- It was here all the time.
- Of course it was.

1347
01:03:28,140 --> 01:03:31,674
I'm not too happy about
cutting these pictures.

1348
01:03:31,675 --> 01:03:34,207
And we only have pictures of
you and I together, babe.

1349
01:03:34,208 --> 01:03:37,774
I actually... I actually
have a photo of Kevin.

1350
01:03:37,775 --> 01:03:39,739
- I know that's strange. Um...
- What?

1351
01:03:39,740 --> 01:03:42,740
No, I have my, um...

1352
01:03:42,741 --> 01:03:46,208
My checking account number is written on
the back of this old photo that I have,

1353
01:03:46,209 --> 01:03:48,474
and it's just been in
my wallet forever.

1354
01:03:48,475 --> 01:03:50,140
It's right here.

1355
01:03:50,141 --> 01:03:52,773
What? You know what?
I-I'll just...

1356
01:03:52,774 --> 01:03:55,906
- I'll cut this picture that we have here.
- Just use this one. It's okay.

1357
01:03:55,907 --> 01:03:59,307
Just scratch off the number. Cut.

1358
01:03:59,308 --> 01:04:01,608
Great. I think we got one of
everybody except me, so...

1359
01:04:01,609 --> 01:04:05,007
I'm glad you guys all keep a lot
of pictures of your friend, Amir.

1360
01:04:05,008 --> 01:04:08,839
Well, we'll take one of you.

1361
01:04:08,840 --> 01:04:12,007
Smile, dickhead.

1362
01:04:13,040 --> 01:04:14,706
Let me see.

1363
01:04:14,707 --> 01:04:16,241
It's not exactly the same.

1364
01:04:16,242 --> 01:04:19,106
It's not the same as the
one from the other box.

1365
01:04:19,107 --> 01:04:22,741
They took a picture of me in the other
house, but it's not exactly the same.

1366
01:04:22,742 --> 01:04:26,041
This is what we're talking about.
That's a moment where it can be...

1367
01:04:26,042 --> 01:04:27,574
a different...
a divergent moment.

1368
01:04:27,575 --> 01:04:29,906
That's what we're gonna do
right now with these dice.

1369
01:04:29,907 --> 01:04:31,774
Wait. Since we're the blue house,

1370
01:04:31,775 --> 01:04:33,307
shouldn't we use a blue pen?

1371
01:04:33,308 --> 01:04:35,141
- Just to make it even more...
- That makes sense.

1372
01:04:35,142 --> 01:04:37,307
Yeah?
The odds go up by three.

1373
01:04:37,308 --> 01:04:39,608
So, does everyone have a die?

1374
01:04:39,609 --> 01:04:41,241
- What's yours?
- Beth?

1375
01:04:41,242 --> 01:04:43,406
All right.

1376
01:04:43,407 --> 01:04:46,508
Six.

1377
01:04:46,509 --> 01:04:48,773
Hugh?
Three.

1378
01:04:48,774 --> 01:04:51,039
Mike?
Four.

1379
01:04:51,040 --> 01:04:53,007
Six.

1380
01:04:53,008 --> 01:04:56,107
Two.

1381
01:04:56,108 --> 01:04:58,407
You guys know what a quick code is?
You know when you...

1382
01:04:58,408 --> 01:05:00,474
are going online, going
into your bank account,

1383
01:05:00,475 --> 01:05:02,507
and when you go to your
password, it'll give you...

1384
01:05:02,508 --> 01:05:04,508
a picture to choose?

1385
01:05:04,509 --> 01:05:08,408
That's your quick code. That's called an
MFA. It's a multi-factor authenticator.

1386
01:05:08,409 --> 01:05:10,940
We do 'em. We put 'em in
whenever we build our big sites.

1387
01:05:10,941 --> 01:05:12,706
It's an icon, right?

1388
01:05:12,707 --> 01:05:15,840
- Sort of a random...
- A random object.

1389
01:05:15,841 --> 01:05:17,639
Yeah. So, what if
each of these...

1390
01:05:17,640 --> 01:05:21,174
has a random object in it to sort
of serve as that quick code, right?

1391
01:05:21,175 --> 01:05:23,440
Right. Right. So, we pick
something to put in there.

1392
01:05:23,441 --> 01:05:27,007
You could put anything in there, right?
A candle or a book or, um...

1393
01:05:27,008 --> 01:05:29,740
- The oven mitt.
- Or a ping-pong paddle.

1394
01:05:29,741 --> 01:05:32,473
Or a ping-pong paddle.
Exactly. Yeah.

1395
01:05:32,474 --> 01:05:36,040
Exactly.

1396
01:05:36,041 --> 01:05:38,906
- Well, how's this? And this is random, right?
- A coaster?

1397
01:05:38,907 --> 01:05:40,973
Is anything really random tonight?

1398
01:05:40,974 --> 01:05:42,674
If you have to leave,

1399
01:05:42,675 --> 01:05:44,173
when you check the box, open it up,

1400
01:05:44,174 --> 01:05:46,173
you see that, you know
you're off to a good start.

1401
01:05:46,174 --> 01:05:47,941
I feel better.

1402
01:05:47,942 --> 01:05:49,573
Okay.
So we've got the box.

1403
01:05:49,574 --> 01:05:52,007
Yeah, and it only took all
night to figure it out.

1404
01:05:52,008 --> 01:05:53,607
We've marked the house.
If we stay together,

1405
01:05:53,608 --> 01:05:57,907
keep our heads up, and nobody
wanders off, we can get through this.

1406
01:05:57,908 --> 01:05:59,539
- Thanks, coach.
- Yeah.

1407
01:05:59,540 --> 01:06:02,574
- You want something?
- Yeah, water. Water would be great.

1408
01:06:02,575 --> 01:06:04,739
I'm gonna get a drink.

1409
01:06:04,740 --> 01:06:08,773
I wonder how different those
numbers are from the first box?

1410
01:06:08,774 --> 01:06:10,706
Let me check.

1411
01:06:10,707 --> 01:06:12,972
Where's my calculator?

1412
01:06:12,973 --> 01:06:18,074
Let's see.
So, if there's eight of us...

1413
01:06:18,075 --> 01:06:22,175
and it's six times six...

1414
01:06:22,176 --> 01:06:24,540
times six.

1415
01:06:24,541 --> 01:06:30,174
Three different colored
glowsticks times three...

1416
01:06:30,175 --> 01:06:35,940
is 5,038,848 possible variables.

1417
01:06:35,941 --> 01:06:39,980
So, that's the variable.

1418
01:06:45,773 --> 01:06:49,970
Are you okay?

1419
01:06:57,376 --> 01:06:59,440
Everything okay with the numbers?

1420
01:06:59,441 --> 01:07:01,373
Yeah.

1421
01:07:01,374 --> 01:07:06,006
D-Do you remember what number was
written on the back of your picture?

1422
01:07:06,007 --> 01:07:08,241
- Five.
- Yeah?

1423
01:07:08,242 --> 01:07:12,375
I found a good spot out front, just as long
as another Hugh and Amir don't come by.

1424
01:07:12,376 --> 01:07:14,906
Kevin, do you remember what number
was written on the back of your picture?

1425
01:07:14,907 --> 01:07:18,573
- Six.
- Yeah?

1426
01:07:18,574 --> 01:07:21,907
- Beth?
- Three.

1427
01:07:21,908 --> 01:07:23,607
Hugh, do you remember?

1428
01:07:23,608 --> 01:07:25,772
- I was a three.
- You sure?

1429
01:07:25,773 --> 01:07:29,706
Yeah. What's going
on in the kitchen?

1430
01:07:29,707 --> 01:07:31,940
- Pound cake.
- Pound cake.

1431
01:07:31,941 --> 01:07:34,640
The girls are breaking
out dessert...

1432
01:07:34,641 --> 01:07:38,413
before the other house eats it.

1433
01:07:41,209 --> 01:07:44,459
Hey, Mike, I need to
show you something.

1434
01:07:46,774 --> 01:07:49,340
The numbers that I remember...

1435
01:07:49,341 --> 01:07:52,774
from the box that was brought
here from the other house...

1436
01:07:52,775 --> 01:07:56,343
are these numbers.

1437
01:07:57,141 --> 01:08:00,474
But these are the numbers
that I found here...

1438
01:08:00,475 --> 01:08:03,539
in this notepad.

1439
01:08:03,540 --> 01:08:07,107
And I just asked everyone if
they can remember their number.

1440
01:08:07,108 --> 01:08:10,308
Beth and Lee are from
this house originally,

1441
01:08:10,309 --> 01:08:13,873
because they have never left.

1442
01:08:13,874 --> 01:08:18,307
But the rest of us...
We are not from this house.

1443
01:08:18,308 --> 01:08:20,807
We are visitors.

1444
01:08:20,808 --> 01:08:24,510
Which means that this
Lee is not your wife.

1445
01:08:25,309 --> 01:08:29,505
Are you with me?

1446
01:08:31,874 --> 01:08:34,807
Well, there's more.

1447
01:08:34,808 --> 01:08:38,140
Because Hugh and Amir...

1448
01:08:38,141 --> 01:08:40,472
are from a third house.

1449
01:08:40,473 --> 01:08:45,142
He just showed me his phone.
It's not cracked.

1450
01:08:45,940 --> 01:08:48,973
Remember that dark area
that we walked through?

1451
01:08:48,974 --> 01:08:51,373
I have a feeling that whoever
walks through that...

1452
01:08:51,374 --> 01:08:55,006
is like they end up in the
middle of a roulette wheel,

1453
01:08:55,007 --> 01:08:58,240
and they will just end
up somewhere by chance.

1454
01:08:58,241 --> 01:09:00,273
And whoever walks through there...

1455
01:09:00,274 --> 01:09:04,078
will not return to the
house that they just left.

1456
01:09:05,622 --> 01:09:10,040
And I think that we need to find our way
back to our house before the comet passes...

1457
01:09:10,041 --> 01:09:12,372
because we... once it...
once it passes,

1458
01:09:12,373 --> 01:09:14,507
we might just be stuck
exact... here.

1459
01:09:14,508 --> 01:09:16,976
Wherever we are.

1460
01:09:17,774 --> 01:09:21,540
I don't want to be stuck here.

1461
01:09:21,541 --> 01:09:23,807
If your theory is true...

1462
01:09:23,808 --> 01:09:25,573
If we walk through the dark space,

1463
01:09:25,574 --> 01:09:27,040
and it is a roulette wheel,

1464
01:09:27,041 --> 01:09:29,174
there's no way we can be sure...

1465
01:09:29,175 --> 01:09:34,106
that we would go back
to our original house.

1466
01:09:34,107 --> 01:09:36,807
I think we just stay here.

1467
01:09:36,808 --> 01:09:39,322
I think we're stuck here.

1468
01:09:39,975 --> 01:09:42,474
I put it out near the gate.
Should be all right.

1469
01:09:42,475 --> 01:09:45,839
If we all stay here,
we should be okay.

1470
01:09:45,840 --> 01:09:47,774
Don't open it.

1471
01:09:47,775 --> 01:09:51,440
Who is that?

1472
01:09:51,441 --> 01:09:53,108
Oh.

1473
01:09:53,109 --> 01:09:55,772
- What is it?
- Mike.

1474
01:09:55,773 --> 01:09:59,074
Oh, fuck me.
Oh, jeez.

1475
01:09:59,075 --> 01:10:00,840
"Mike, my friend, What is it?

1476
01:10:00,841 --> 01:10:04,173
Beth plus book equals Trinidad Club.

1477
01:10:04,174 --> 01:10:06,241
Don't let it happen,
whatever it takes, buddy."

1478
01:10:06,242 --> 01:10:08,507
What is this?

1479
01:10:08,508 --> 01:10:10,674
It's just this note.
It's... Mike had this...

1480
01:10:10,675 --> 01:10:13,840
He had this crazy idea that maybe
if he left this note out there,

1481
01:10:13,841 --> 01:10:15,274
it could stop them
getting the book.

1482
01:10:15,275 --> 01:10:16,973
It's nothing.
It was a stupid idea.

1483
01:10:16,974 --> 01:10:19,173
But our Mike didn't deliver it.
What is this?

1484
01:10:19,174 --> 01:10:21,107
Just some crazy other Mike
running around. It's nothing.

1485
01:10:21,108 --> 01:10:23,339
- You know what it is? What is this?
- We talked about it.

1486
01:10:23,340 --> 01:10:25,040
What is it?
Really, it's nothing.

1487
01:10:25,041 --> 01:10:27,208
- Just let it go, and...
- Then why can't you tell us?

1488
01:10:27,209 --> 01:10:30,046
Beth?

1489
01:10:33,841 --> 01:10:36,474
Mike, what is this?
Oh, shit.

1490
01:10:36,475 --> 01:10:39,339
It's...

1491
01:10:39,340 --> 01:10:40,940
Nothing.

1492
01:10:40,941 --> 01:10:42,906
If it's nothing,
then why does my wife...

1493
01:10:42,907 --> 01:10:44,707
have a fucking nosebleed?

1494
01:10:44,708 --> 01:10:47,808
- Oh.
- Oh, honey. Oh, God. Oh, God.

1495
01:10:47,809 --> 01:10:49,707
- Beth, what the hell is this?
- I told you.

1496
01:10:49,708 --> 01:10:51,907
- I told you this was the worst.
- What is the idea?

1497
01:10:51,908 --> 01:10:54,173
12 years ago.
Mike and Beth.

1498
01:10:54,174 --> 01:10:56,073
- You've gotta be kidding me.
- He was gonna blackmail himself...

1499
01:10:56,074 --> 01:11:00,174
- What is this?
- so they would not get the book.

1500
01:11:00,175 --> 01:11:02,306
This is bad.
This is really bad.

1501
01:11:02,307 --> 01:11:06,141
- Wait. You never told Hugh?
- It was on my to-do list.

1502
01:11:06,142 --> 01:11:08,439
We have to just get
through the night, okay?

1503
01:11:08,440 --> 01:11:11,606
Let's just try. He told you.
He said he told you about it.

1504
01:11:11,607 --> 01:11:13,107
Why didn't you tell me?

1505
01:11:13,108 --> 01:11:16,907
- Because you didn't say anything about it.
- Who else knew about this?

1506
01:11:16,908 --> 01:11:18,906
Who else knew about this?

1507
01:11:18,907 --> 01:11:21,439
- Lee, did you know about this?
- Yes.

1508
01:11:21,440 --> 01:11:24,440
- Kevin, did you know?
- He told us. He told you. He...

1509
01:11:24,441 --> 01:11:27,006
- Everybody knew about this.
- We thought you knew.

1510
01:11:27,007 --> 01:11:29,373
Everybody knew about this except me?

1511
01:11:29,374 --> 01:11:34,405
Hugh, listen. It's...
It's not what it seems. It's...

1512
01:11:34,406 --> 01:11:38,274
- We don't even belong here.
- You are fucking too much, man.

1513
01:11:38,275 --> 01:11:41,272
- You are fucking too much.
- Listen. We're visitors here.

1514
01:11:41,273 --> 01:11:43,206
- This isn't our house.
- What are you talking about?

1515
01:11:43,207 --> 01:11:44,807
This is Lee and Beth's house.

1516
01:11:44,808 --> 01:11:48,074
You sleep with my wife, and
this is what you're telling me?

1517
01:11:48,075 --> 01:11:49,540
Check your phone.
Is your phone broken?

1518
01:11:49,541 --> 01:11:51,672
What the fuck does that
have to do with anything?

1519
01:11:51,673 --> 01:11:54,906
- Is your phone broken?
- What the fuck does that have to do with anything?

1520
01:11:54,907 --> 01:11:57,840
- Just do it.
- Show us.

1521
01:11:57,841 --> 01:11:59,473
No. My phone is not broken.

1522
01:11:59,474 --> 01:12:02,206
Now what does that have to do
with you sleeping with my wife?

1523
01:12:02,207 --> 01:12:05,040
From the beginning of the
evening, your phone was broken.

1524
01:12:05,041 --> 01:12:07,307
- No. Em's phone is broken.
- So is yours.

1525
01:12:07,308 --> 01:12:10,074
Your... The box. The
first box that we got,

1526
01:12:10,075 --> 01:12:11,974
we had, like, a random item.

1527
01:12:11,975 --> 01:12:13,573
W-What w-was your random item?

1528
01:12:13,574 --> 01:12:15,607
What the fuck does this
have to do with anything?

1529
01:12:15,608 --> 01:12:17,807
Answer him.

1530
01:12:17,808 --> 01:12:21,173
- The stapler.
- No, no, no.

1531
01:12:21,174 --> 01:12:22,873
- What?
- We had an oven mitt.

1532
01:12:22,874 --> 01:12:24,974
And ours was a ping-pong paddle.

1533
01:12:24,975 --> 01:12:27,306
- What?
- Mine was a napkin.

1534
01:12:27,307 --> 01:12:29,572
What the fuck are you talking about?

1535
01:12:29,573 --> 01:12:33,573
Hugh, that is not my Lee. That is not
your Beth, and I am not your Mike.

1536
01:12:33,574 --> 01:12:35,507
You... You aren't mad at me.

1537
01:12:35,508 --> 01:12:38,336
W-We're in a different...
a different reality here.

1538
01:12:38,337 --> 01:12:41,474
Yeah, we're in a different reality
because the reality where I am from,

1539
01:12:41,475 --> 01:12:44,040
my best friend didn't
sleep with my wife.

1540
01:12:44,041 --> 01:12:46,939
Hugh, do you not understand
what I'm saying?

1541
01:12:46,940 --> 01:12:51,907
This all started tonight, and if there
are a million different realities,

1542
01:12:51,908 --> 01:12:54,606
I have slept with your wife
in every one of them.

1543
01:12:54,607 --> 01:12:57,874
- You fucking...
- No, no, no.

1544
01:12:57,875 --> 01:13:01,807
Hugh! Hugh!

1545
01:13:01,808 --> 01:13:04,073
Come on!

1546
01:13:04,074 --> 01:13:06,138
- Are you okay?
- Yeah. Settle down.

1547
01:13:06,139 --> 01:13:09,759
I'm gonna get some ice.
I'm gonna get some ice.

1548
01:13:10,573 --> 01:13:13,873
Are you okay?

1549
01:13:13,874 --> 01:13:17,640
Sit down.

1550
01:13:17,641 --> 01:13:19,374
You okay, baby?

1551
01:13:19,375 --> 01:13:21,673
- Here, let me give you a little of this.
- Yeah, yeah.

1552
01:13:21,674 --> 01:13:26,239
Okay, I'm going to put something on it.
I'll put something on it.

1553
01:13:26,874 --> 01:13:30,974
You know, I've made some... some
choices, that I'm stuck with. Um...

1554
01:13:30,975 --> 01:13:36,140
I'm stuck here.

1555
01:13:36,808 --> 01:13:40,006
I'm like the dead cat, right?

1556
01:13:40,007 --> 01:13:41,572
This whole night we've
been worrying...

1557
01:13:41,573 --> 01:13:46,973
there's some dark version
of us out there somewhere.

1558
01:13:46,974 --> 01:13:49,877
What if we're the dark version?

1559
01:13:50,675 --> 01:13:52,740
What's that?

1560
01:13:52,741 --> 01:13:54,807
- All right.
- Goddamn it!

1561
01:13:54,808 --> 01:13:59,005
Why didn't you tell me?

1562
01:14:02,574 --> 01:14:05,105
There's someone in the house.

1563
01:14:05,106 --> 01:14:07,206
Get the hell outta here!

1564
01:14:07,207 --> 01:14:10,707
- Oh. No, no, no, no, no.
- Jesus. What's going on?

1565
01:14:10,708 --> 01:14:12,305
- Is he all right?
- Are you okay?

1566
01:14:12,306 --> 01:14:15,073
- Who the fuck was that?
- Mike? Mike?

1567
01:14:15,074 --> 01:14:18,039
Does anybody know what to do?

1568
01:14:18,040 --> 01:14:20,139
- Mike?
- Is he breathing?

1569
01:14:20,140 --> 01:14:24,774
- Jesus Christ!
- Laurie, it's okay.

1570
01:14:25,073 --> 01:14:27,274
- Calm down.
- Laurie, Laurie, stop.

1571
01:14:27,275 --> 01:14:30,673
Laurie, Jesus.

1572
01:14:30,674 --> 01:14:33,607
- Shh.
- Kevin, shut her the fuck up.

1573
01:14:33,608 --> 01:14:35,239
It's okay, Laurie.

1574
01:14:35,240 --> 01:14:37,573
Just breathe. You're all right.
You're all right.

1575
01:14:37,574 --> 01:14:40,941
Em. Em.

1576
01:14:40,942 --> 01:14:44,174
Em, where are you going?

1577
01:14:45,374 --> 01:14:49,205
Just calm down.
It's all right.

1578
01:14:49,206 --> 01:14:52,874
- Get off me!
- Get a rag. Get a towel. Anything.

1579
01:14:52,875 --> 01:14:54,672
- Here, here, here, here.
- Get it off!

1580
01:14:54,673 --> 01:14:57,706
- Get it off! I can't fucking stand blood.
- Okay. It's off.

1581
01:14:57,707 --> 01:15:00,695
It'll be all right.
Just calm down.

1582
01:15:51,540 --> 01:15:54,874
Get the fuck away.
Get the fuck away.

1583
01:15:54,875 --> 01:15:58,178
You're scaring the shit
out of everybody.

1584
01:15:58,408 --> 01:16:04,160
Who are you? Who are
you fucking people?

1585
01:16:21,941 --> 01:16:23,939
And you said... All
you guys are crazy.

1586
01:16:23,940 --> 01:16:27,972
You were always fucking crazy.

1587
01:16:27,973 --> 01:16:29,540
She's bad news.

1588
01:16:29,541 --> 01:16:32,949
It's been years we
haven't seen each other.

1589
01:17:07,441 --> 01:17:10,473
You know, Vietnamese is
a pitch-based language.

1590
01:17:10,474 --> 01:17:15,174
D.H.R. Yeah.

1591
01:17:16,374 --> 01:17:21,075
It really is a pitch-based language.

1592
01:17:21,873 --> 01:17:24,873
- Hi.
- Hi.

1593
01:17:24,874 --> 01:17:27,998
Cheers.

1594
01:17:59,774 --> 01:18:01,673
And I don't think
I'm working a lot.

1595
01:18:01,674 --> 01:18:06,739
I have to work a lot, but
it's gonna be a nice balance.

1596
01:18:06,740 --> 01:18:10,806
What are you gonna do while he's working?
What are you gonna do?

1597
01:18:10,807 --> 01:18:12,607
I don't know.
Just hang out.

1598
01:18:12,608 --> 01:18:14,106
- Investigate?
- Yeah, investigate.

1599
01:18:14,107 --> 01:18:16,407
Fundraise. Get those
Vietnamese to invest in...

1600
01:18:16,408 --> 01:18:20,506
- Fundraise in San Francisco.
- Invest in the Vietnamese.

1601
01:18:20,507 --> 01:18:23,472
- It's supposed to be gorgeous, though.
- This time of year.

1602
01:18:23,473 --> 01:18:25,805
My cousin lived over there
for about a year...

1603
01:18:25,806 --> 01:18:27,339
and said it was just spectacular.

1604
01:18:27,340 --> 01:18:31,740
- Have you been there before?
- No. Not Vietnam. Cambodia.

1605
01:18:31,741 --> 01:18:33,273
Cambodia was awesome.

1606
01:18:33,274 --> 01:18:35,139
Did you see Angkor Wat
when you were in Cambodia?

1607
01:18:35,140 --> 01:18:37,973
- Yeah.
- Good times.

1608
01:18:39,974 --> 01:18:42,907
Great.

1609
01:18:43,374 --> 01:18:45,571
Picture this.

1610
01:18:45,572 --> 01:18:47,673
- Whoa. What the hell was that?
- What was that?

1611
01:18:47,674 --> 01:18:50,240
- It was like a car window, or something.
- It sounded like glass.

1612
01:18:50,241 --> 01:18:52,073
It sounded like a windshield.

1613
01:18:52,074 --> 01:18:53,639
That's mine.
That's mine.

1614
01:18:53,640 --> 01:18:55,838
Should we get the, the
glowsticks to take outside?

1615
01:18:55,839 --> 01:18:57,340
We're not going to a rave.

1616
01:18:57,341 --> 01:19:00,172
You want to go to a rave, party man?

1617
01:19:00,173 --> 01:19:02,406
I don't see anybody.

1618
01:19:02,407 --> 01:19:04,339
You okay?

1619
01:19:04,340 --> 01:19:07,772
- Whose is that right there?
- Oh, for fuck's sake. Seriously?

1620
01:19:07,773 --> 01:19:11,439
- Oh, shit.
- Oh, baby.

1621
01:19:11,440 --> 01:19:14,740
- I just got this. I just got this.
- I'm sorry.

1622
01:19:14,741 --> 01:19:17,406
There's no structural damage.

1623
01:19:17,407 --> 01:19:20,072
- Did they take anything?
- They didn't take my fucking...

1624
01:19:20,073 --> 01:19:22,239
- They didn't take my stereo.
- Come on.

1625
01:19:22,240 --> 01:19:25,473
Why don't we check
the rest of our cars,

1626
01:19:25,474 --> 01:19:26,939
and see what's going on.

1627
01:19:26,940 --> 01:19:28,572
- Yeah.
- Honey, where's our car?

1628
01:19:28,573 --> 01:19:30,472
- In the driveway.
- All right.

1629
01:19:30,473 --> 01:19:35,642
- Em, you good?
- Yeah. I'm right up here.

1630
01:20:17,706 --> 01:20:20,073
- Hey.
- Hey.

1631
01:20:20,074 --> 01:20:22,673
What are you doing?
We... Guys, she's in here.

1632
01:20:22,674 --> 01:20:24,205
We were looking for you.

1633
01:20:24,206 --> 01:20:27,806
- Oh, I was just, um, by my car.
- Oh.

1634
01:20:27,807 --> 01:20:31,940
- You okay, babe?
- Yeah, I just... Yeah.

1635
01:20:31,941 --> 01:20:34,439
- You got away from us.
- I did.

1636
01:20:34,440 --> 01:20:37,307
I guess worse things could
happen at a dinner party.

1637
01:20:37,308 --> 01:20:39,305
I went and got the...
the ring.

1638
01:20:39,306 --> 01:20:42,805
No, I could stay here.
That's a good idea.

1639
01:20:42,806 --> 01:20:45,107
What were you doing out there?

1640
01:20:45,108 --> 01:20:49,106
Em. What were you doing out there?

1641
01:20:49,107 --> 01:20:52,239
Um, the view is really beautiful
of the comet out there.

1642
01:20:52,240 --> 01:20:54,871
- Oh.
- You came in that door?

1643
01:20:54,872 --> 01:20:57,473
- Yeah.
- What's wrong with that door?

1644
01:20:57,474 --> 01:21:00,540
That's the door to nowhere.
Don't you know?

1645
01:21:00,541 --> 01:21:02,839
Okay. Let's go take a look.
Let's check it out.

1646
01:21:02,840 --> 01:21:06,939
Everybody's sick of hearing
about the feng shui.

1647
01:21:06,940 --> 01:21:10,006
- God, it's freezing outside.
- Come on.

1648
01:21:10,007 --> 01:21:12,672
You mentioned it.
Let's look at it.

1649
01:21:12,673 --> 01:21:14,639
How come we never use this patio?

1650
01:21:14,640 --> 01:21:16,406
Well, we never have comets.

1651
01:21:16,407 --> 01:21:19,573
Oh, my God.

1652
01:21:19,574 --> 01:21:21,373
W-What's it doing?

1653
01:21:21,374 --> 01:21:23,407
It's breaking up.

1654
01:21:23,408 --> 01:21:25,673
- Is that what they do?
- Yeah, I guess so.

1655
01:21:25,674 --> 01:21:28,973
So, Em, is Katherine Meriss gonna understudy
your life while you're gone for a month?

1656
01:21:28,974 --> 01:21:32,007
Oh, no one can.
Ooh.

1657
01:21:32,540 --> 01:21:36,707
- I like that.
- Oh, come on.

1658
01:21:38,740 --> 01:21:41,172
I wish we could roast
marshmallows on that meteor.

1659
01:21:41,173 --> 01:21:44,531
A long stick.

1660
01:22:32,740 --> 01:22:34,572
Yeah?

1661
01:22:34,573 --> 01:22:36,506
- Em? You okay?
- Yeah?

1662
01:22:36,507 --> 01:22:39,172
Yeah, I'm fine.
The toilet just got backed up.

1663
01:22:39,173 --> 01:22:42,005
You can't use that one. You
gotta use the main one, okay?

1664
01:22:42,006 --> 01:22:45,938
Okay.
I'll be right out.

1665
01:23:28,640 --> 01:23:32,446
- Oh, my God.
- Em. Em.

1666
01:24:22,275 --> 01:24:24,940
Hey. You're up.

1667
01:24:24,941 --> 01:24:29,852
I'll make some breakfast. It'll
be ready in, like, five minutes.

1668
01:24:49,607 --> 01:24:51,905
Oh, hi.
You feeling better?

1669
01:24:51,906 --> 01:24:54,005
- Yeah.
- Okay.

1670
01:24:54,006 --> 01:24:57,115
I'm gonna get dressed.
I'll be back.

1671
01:25:29,674 --> 01:25:32,873
Morning.

1672
01:25:32,874 --> 01:25:35,240
You okay, babe?

1673
01:25:35,241 --> 01:25:38,006
Are you okay?

1674
01:25:38,007 --> 01:25:41,708
You totally passed out last night.

1675
01:25:42,506 --> 01:25:46,239
You were mumbling.
I put you on the couch.

1676
01:25:46,240 --> 01:25:49,842
Found that in the bathroom.

1677
01:25:56,041 --> 01:26:00,374
That's weird.
It's you calling me.

1678
01:26:01,173 --> 01:26:04,274
Hello?

1679
01:26:14,508 --> 01:26:18,609
<i>When you sing</i>

1680
01:26:20,406 --> 01:26:25,075
<i>When you sing</i>

1681
01:26:26,872 --> 01:26:31,572
<i>The stars</i>

1682
01:26:31,573 --> 01:26:36,442
<i>Fill up my eyes</i>

1683
01:26:39,240 --> 01:26:44,906
<i>Galaxies pour down my cheeks</i>

1684
01:26:44,907 --> 01:26:48,475
<i>Galaxies</i>
